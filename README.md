# Lexata-Project
## Introduction

We are working for a Canadian based company named Lexata. This company is giving prompt services and advice to common layman and Industry professionals with Business acumen. It offers services such as financial statements, Ownership Reporting and Takeover bid exemptions, non-GAAP financial measures, Investment funds, AGM calculators, Related party Transactions, MJDS reporting and Diversity.
Client works in Capital Market field regulations related to the trading of stocks and shares. Once a particular company goes public (private company’s initial public offering), it can sell their shares to the public (common people) to invest in their company. If this specific company violates any law related to capital market regulations, then the investors(public) can file a case against the company. So, our client Lexata is a law firm which helps the investors to file such cases. 

## Aims of the Project
Lexata is a start-up company and aims of the project changes according to tasks. Hence, we got the exposure to work in the flexible Environment. The main advantage is that we learned lot of different things, tools, and technology through it.
Current aims of the project consist of several deliverable tasks which are an integral part of our main goal.
•	The main aim of this project is to build a better semantic search system for the capital market research data by connecting GPT-3 with Lexata website. 
•	Creating a recommendation system using the word embeddings
•	The text Mining of the SEC website to extract the data related to the filings of a particular company.
•	Future planning of Lexata website using AWS:
In this task, we figured out various approach through which we can upload large number of files on AWS. Initially we found difficulties to upload large number of files on AWS due to its limited capacity. Also, we thought about uploading files through various other AWS services such as EC2, S3 but again got difficulty because of the limited size. The effective way to upload the files on AWS is making the use of Amazon CLI (Command Line Interface). It gives wide access of commands to upload files from your local file system into amazon storage space. Also, there is an alternative way is Filezilla Pro. It works as per client server model where we can upload multiple files at one time with fast processing speed. We compared both the techniques and figured out that CLI is an effective method.
Design of AWS Lambda -: This is an alternative but important task performed by us. AWS Lambda is a core component (Heart) of Lexata Backend and its Data management. The main use of AWS Lambda is handling the data on cloud using its services.  The detailed analysis of this task is explained in Approach and methodology section.
