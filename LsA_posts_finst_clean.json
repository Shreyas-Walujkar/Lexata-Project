{"metadata":"9968","text":"(1) Subsection 10.2(2) of Form 44-101F1 requires prescribed disclosure of a proposed acquisition that has progressed to a state where a reasonable person would believe that the likelihood of the acquisition being completed is high and that would, if completed on the date of the short form prospectus, be a significant acquisition for the purposes of Part 8 of NI 51-102 . When interpreting the phrase where a reasonable person would believe that the likelihood of the acquisition being completed is high, it is our view that the following factors may be relevant in determining whether the likelihood of an acquisition being completed is high: (a) whether the acquisition has been publicly announced; (b) whether the acquisition is the subject of an executed agreement; and (c) the nature of conditions to the completion of the acquisition including any material third party consents required. The test of whether a proposed acquisition has progressed to a state where a reasonable person would believe that the likelihood of the acquisition being completed is high is an objective, rather than subjective, test in that the question turns on what a reasonable person would believe. It is not sufficient for an officer of an issuer to determine that he or she personally believes that the likelihood of the acquisition being completed is or is not high. The officer must form an opinion as to what a reasonable person would believe in the circumstances. In the event of a dispute, an objective test requires an adjudicator to decide whether a reasonable person would believe in the circumstances that the likelihood of an acquisition being completed was high. By contrast, if the disclosure requirement involved a subjective test, the adjudicator would assess an individual's credibility and decide whether the personal opinion of the individual as to whether the likelihood of the acquisition being completed was high was an honestly held opinion. Formulating the disclosure requirement using an objective test rather than a subjective test strengthens the basis upon which the regulator may object to an issuer's application of the test in particular circumstances.(2) Subsection 10.2(3) of Form 44-101F1 requires inclusion of the financial statements or other information relating to certain acquisitions or proposed acquisitions if the inclusion of the financial statements or other information is necessary in order for the short form prospectus to contain full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities being distributed. We generally presume that the inclusion of financial statements or other information is required for all acquisitions that are, or would be, significant under Part 8 of NI 51-102 . Issuers can rebut this presumption if they can provide evidence that the financial statements or other information are not required for full, true and plain disclosure. Subsection 10.2(4) of Form 44-101F1 provides that issuers must satisfy the requirements of subsection 10.2(3) of Form 44-101F1 by including either: (i) the financial statements or other information that would be required by Part 8 of NI 51-102 ; or (ii) satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information. Satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information may be provided to satisfy the requirements of subsection 10.2(3) when the financial statements or other information that would be required by Part 8 of NI 51-102 relate to a financial year ended within 90 days before the date of the prospectus or an interim period ended within 60 days before the date of the prospectus for issuers that are venture issuers, and 45 days for issuers that are not venture issuers. In these circumstances, we believe that satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information would not have to include any financial statements or other information for the acquisition or probable acquisition related to: (a) a financial year ended within 90 days before the date of the short form prospectus; or (b) an interim period ended within 60 days before the date of the short form prospectus for issuers that are venture issuers, and 45 days for issuers that are not venture issuers. An example of satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information that we will generally find acceptable would be: (c) comparative annual financial statements or other information for the acquisition or probable acquisition for at least the number of financial years as would be required under Part 8 of NI 51-102 that ended more than 90 days before the date of the short form prospectus, audited for the most recently completed financial period in accordance with NI 52-107 , and reviewed for the comparative period in accordance with section 4.3 of NI 44-101; (d) a comparative interim financial report or other information for the acquisition or probable acquisition for any interim period ended subsequent to the latest annual financial statements included in the short form prospectus and more than 60 days before the date of the short form prospectus for issuers that are venture issuers, and 45 days for issuers that are not venture issuers reviewed in accordance with section 4.3 of NI 44-101; and (e) pro forma financial statements or other information required under Part 8 of NI 51-102 . If the issuer intends to include financial statements as set out in the example above as satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information, we ask that this be highlighted in the cover letter to the prospectus. If the issuer does not intend to include financial statements or other information, or intends to file financial statements or other information that are different from those set out above, we encourage the utilization of pre-filing procedures.(3) When an issuer acquires a business or related businesses that has itself recently acquired another business or related businesses (an indirect acquisition), the issuer should consider whether prospectus disclosure about the indirect acquisition, including historical financial statements, is necessary to satisfy the requirement that the prospectus contain full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities being distributed. In making this determination, the issuer should consider the following factors:  if the indirect acquisition would meet any of the significance tests in Part 8 of NI 51-102 when the issuer applies each of those tests to its proportionate interest in the indirect acquisition of the business; and  if the amount of time between the separate acquisitions is such that the effect of the first acquisition is not adequately reflected in the results of the business or related businesses the issuer is acquiring.  (4) Subsection 10.2(3) discusses financial statements or other information for the completed or proposed acquisition of the business or related businesses. This other information is intended to capture the financial information disclosures required under Part 8 of NI 51-102 other than financial statements.

Issuers should update the disclosure in the prospectus accordingly in order to satisfy the requirement that the long form prospectus contain full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities being distributed. However, if historical financial information derived from more recent annual financial statements or interim financial report is released to the public by the issuer before the financial statements are filed, the prospectus should include the information included in the news release or public communication. There is no specific requirement in the Instrument to otherwise update the prospectus, or pro forma financial statements to reflect the more recent information. We think the directors of an issuer should endeavor to consider and approve financial statements in a timely manner and should not delay the approval and filing of the financial statements for the purpose of avoiding their inclusion in a long form prospectus. Once the directors have approved an issuer's financial statements, the issuer should file them as soon as possible. General financial statement requirements"},
{"metadata":"9972","text":"(1) An issuer is required to provide historical financial statements under Item 32 of Form 41-101F1 for a business or related businesses that a reasonable investor would regard as the primary business of the issuer. However, if the issuer is a reporting issuer whose principal assets are not cash, cash equivalents or an exchange listing, and the acquisition of the primary business represents a significant acquisition for the issuer, the reporting issuer is subject to the requirements of Item 35 in respect of the financial statement and other disclosure for the acquisition.An acquisition does not include a reverse takeover, as defined in NI 41-101 which cross-references the meaning of acquisition as used in Part 8 of NI 51-10 2. Therefore a reporting issuer cannot rely on the exemption in subsection 32.1(2) if the applicable transaction is a reverse takeover. Examples of when a reasonable investor would regard the primary business of the issuer to be the acquired business or related businesses, thereby triggering the application of Item 32, are when the acquisition(s) was (a) a reverse takeover, (b) a qualifying transaction for a Capital Pool Company, or (c) an acquisition that is a significant acquisition at over the 100% level under sub section 35.1(4) of Form 41-101F1 . The issuer should consider the facts of each situation to determine whether a reasonable investor would regard the primary business of the issuer to be the acquired business or related businesses.(2) The periods for which the issuer must provide financial statements under Item 32 of Form 41-101F1 for an acquired business or businesses that are regarded as the primary business of the issuer should be determined in reference to sections 32.2 and 32.3 of Form 41-101F1, and with the same exceptions, where applicable, set out in paragraphs 32.4 (a) through (e) of Form 41-101F1.

{"metadata":"9974","text":"(1) Item 32 of Form 41-101F1 prescribes the issuer financial statements that must be included in a long form prospectus. We recognize that an issuer, at the time of filing a long form prospectus, may have been in existence for less than one year. We expect that in many situations the limited historical financial statement information that is available for such an issuer may be adequately supplemented by other relevant information disclosed in the long form prospectus. However, if the issuer cannot provide financial statements for a period of at least 12 months and the long form prospectus does not otherwise contain information concerning the business conducted or to be conducted by the issuer that is sufficient to enable an investor to make an informed investment decision, a securities regulatory authority or regulator may consider this a key factor when deciding whether it should refuse to issue a receipt for the long form prospectus.(2) A reference to a prospectus includes a preliminary prospectus. Consequently, the time references in sections 32.2 , 32.3 , 35.5 and 35.6 of Form 41-101F1 should be considered as at the date of the preliminary long form prospectus and again at the date of the final long form prospectus for both the issuer and any business acquired or to be acquired. Depending on the period of time between the dates of the preliminary and final long form prospectuses, an issuer may have to include more recent financial statements.(3) An issuer is subject to certain additional disclosure requirements when it discloses an interim financial report for a period in the year of adopting IFRS, as set out in subparagraph 32.3 (2)(e) and subsection 32.3 (4) of Form 41-101F1. These requirements only apply to interim financial reports relating to periods in the year of adopting IFRS and therefore do not apply if the prospectus includes annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. An issuer is required to provide an opening IFRS statement of financial position at the date of transition to IFRS. An issuer with, for example, a year-end of December 31, 2010 that files a prospectus for which it must include its first interim financial report in the year of adopting IFRS for the period ended March 31, 2011, must generally provide an opening IFRS statement of financial position at January 1, 2010.An issuer must also include various reconciliations required by IFRS 1 to explain how the transition from previous GAAP to IFRS has affected its reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows. In the first interim period IFRS 1 requires certain additional reconciliations which relate to annual periods and the date of transition to IFRS. Where an issuer that was not a reporting issuer in at least one jurisdiction immediately before filing the prospectus includes an interim financial report in respect of the second or third interim period in the year of adopting IFRS, subsection 32.3 (4) of Form 41-101F1 requires these additional reconciliations to be included in the prospectus. Alternatively, pursuant to subsection 32.3 (4) of Form 41-101F1, the issuer may include the first interim financial report in the year of adopting IFRS as this report includes the required reconciliations.These additional reconciliations may be summarized as follows:  reconciliations of the issuer's equity presented in accordance with previous GAAP to its equity in accordance with IFRS for the date of transition to IFRS (January 1, 2010 in the above-noted example);  reconciliations of the issuer's equity presented in accordance with previous GAAP to its equity in accordance with IFRS for the end of the latest period presented in the issuer's most recent annual financial statements in accordance with previous GAAP (December 31, 2010 in the above-noted example); and  a reconciliation of the issuer's total comprehensive income (or total profit or loss) presented in accordance with previous GAAP to its total comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS for the latest period in the issuer's most recent annual financial statements presented in the prospectus in accordance with previous GAAP (year ended December 31, 2010 in the above-noted example).The reconciliations summarized above must give sufficient detail to enable investors to understand the material adjustments to the statement of financial position, statement of comprehensive income and statement of cash flows.

The issuer has emerged from bankruptcy and current management is denied access to the historical accounting records necessary to audit the financial statements. (b) In this case, as a condition of granting the exemption, the issuer may be requested by a securities regulatory authority or regulator to (i) represent in writing to the securities regulatory authority or regulator, no later than the time the preliminary long form prospectus is filed, that the issuer has made every reasonable effort to obtain access to, or copies of, the historical accounting records necessary to audit the financial statements but that such efforts were unsuccessful, and (ii) disclose in the long form prospectus the fact that the issuer has emerged from bankruptcy and current management is denied access to the historical accounting records. The issuer has undergone a fundamental change in the nature of its business or operations affecting a majority of its operations and all, or substantially all, of the executive officers and directors of the company have changed.

Completed significant acquisitions and the obligation to provide business acquisition report level disclosure for a non-reporting issuer (2) For an issuer that is not a reporting issuer in any jurisdiction immediately before filing the long form prospectus (a non-reporting issuer), the long form prospectus disclosure requirements for a significant acquisition are generally intended to mirror those for reporting issuers subject to Part 8 of NI 51-102 . To determine whether an acquisition is significant, non-reporting issuers would first look to the guidance under section 8.3 of NI 51-102 . The initial test for significance would be calculated based on the financial statements of the issuer and acquired business or related businesses for the most recently completed financial year of each that ended before the acquisition date.To recognize the possible growth of a non-reporting issuer between the date of its most recently completed year end and the acquisition date and the corresponding potential decline in significance of the acquisition to the issuer, issuers should refer to the guidance in paragraph 35.1 (4)(b) of Form 41-101F1 to perform the optional test. The applicable time period for this optional test for the issuer is the most recently completed interim period or financial year for which financial statements of the issuer are included in the prospectus and for the acquired business or related businesses is the most recently completed interim period or financial year ended before the date of the long form prospectus.The significance thresholds for IPO venture issuers are identical to the significance thresholds for venture issuers.The timing of the disclosure requirements set out in subsection 35.3 (1) of Form 41-101F1 are based on the principles under section 8.2 of NI 51-102 . For reporting issuers, subsection 8.2 (2) of NI 51-102 sets out the timing of disclosures for significant acquisitions where the acquisition occurs within 45 days after the year end of the acquired business. However, for IPO venture issuers, paragraph 35.3 (1)(d) imposes a disclosure requirement for all significant acquisitions completed more than 90 days before the date of the long form prospectus, where the acquisition occurs within 45 days after the year end of the acquired business. This differs from the business acquisition report filing deadline for venture issuers under paragraph 8.2 (2)(b) of NI 51-102 where the business acquisition report deadline for any significant acquisition where the acquisition occurs within 45 days after the year end of the acquired business is within 120 days after the acquisition date. Probable acquisitions (3) When interpreting the phrase where a reasonable person would believe that the likelihood of the acquisition being completed is high, it is our view that the following factors may be relevant in determining whether the likelihood of an acquisition being completed is high: (a) whether the acquisition has been publicly announced; (b) whether the acquisition is the subject of an executed agreement; (c) the nature of conditions to the completion of the acquisition including any material third party consents required. The test of whether a proposed acquisition has progressed to a state where a reasonable person would believe that the likelihood of the acquisition being completed is high is an objective, rather than subjective, test in that the question turns on what a reasonable person would believe. It is not sufficient for an officer of an issuer to determine that he or she personally believes that the likelihood of the acquisition being completed is or is not high. The officer must form an opinion as to what a reasonable person would believe in the circumstances. In the event of a dispute, an objective test requires an adjudicator to decide whether a reasonable person would believe in the circumstances that the likelihood of an acquisition being completed was high. By contrast, if the disclosure requirement involved a subjective test, the adjudicator would assess an individual's credibility and decide whether the personal opinion of the individual as to whether the likelihood of the acquisition being completed was high was an honestly held opinion. Formulating the disclosure requirement using an objective test rather than a subjective test strengthens the basis upon which the regulator may object to an issuer's application of the test in particular circumstances.We generally presume that the inclusion of financial statements or other information is required for all acquisitions that are, or would be, significant under Part 8 of NI 51-102 . Reporting issuers can rebut this presumption if they can provide evidence that the financial statements or other information are not required for full, true and plain disclosure. Satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information (4) Issuers must satisfy the disclosure requirements in section 35.5 or section 35.6 of Form 41-101F1 by including either: (i) the financial statements or other information that would be required by Part 8 of NI 51-102 ; or (ii) satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information. Satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information may be provided to satisfy the requirements of subsection 35.5 (3) or subsection 35.6 (3) of Form 41-101F1 when the financial statements or other information that would be required by Part 8 of NI 51-102 relate to a financial year ended within 90 days before the date of the long form prospectus or an interim period ended within 60 days before the date of the long form prospectus for issuers that are venture issuers, and 45 days for issuers that are not venture issuers. In these circumstances, we believe that satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information would not have to include any financial statements or other information for the acquisition or probable acquisition related to: (a) a financial year ended within 90 days before the date of the long form prospectus; or (b) an interim period ended within 60 days before the date of the long form prospectus for issuers that are venture issuers, and 45 days for issuers that are not venture issuers. An example of satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information that we will generally find acceptable would be: (c) comparative annual financial statements or other information for the acquisition or probable acquisition for at least the number of financial years as would be required under Part 8 of NI 51-102 that ended more than 90 days before the date of the long form prospectus, audited for the most recently completed financial period in accordance with section 4.2 of the Instrument, and reviewed for the comparative period in accordance with section 4.3 of the Instrument; (d) a comparative interim financial report or other information for the acquisition or probable acquisition for any interim period ended subsequent to the latest annual financial statements included in the long form prospectus and more than 60 days before the date of the long form prospectus for issuers that are venture issuers, and 45 days for issuers that are not venture issuers reviewed in accordance with section 4.3 of the Instrument; and (e) pro forma financial statements or other information required under Part 8 of NI 51-102 . If the issuer intends to include financial statements as set out in the example above as satisfactory alternative financial statements, we ask that this be highlighted in the cover letter to the long form prospectus. If the issuer does not intend to include financial statements or other information, or intends to file financial statements or other information that are different from those set out above, the issuer should use the pre-filing procedures in NP 11-202. Acquired business has recently completed an acquisition (5) When an issuer acquires a business or related businesses that has itself recently acquired another business or related businesses (an indirect acquisition), the issuer should consider whether long form prospectus disclosure about the indirect acquisition, including historical financial statements, is necessary to satisfy the requirement that the long form prospectus contain full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities being distributed. In making this determination, the issuer should consider the following factors:  if the indirect acquisition would meet any of the significance tests in section 35.1 (4) of Form 41-101F1 when the issuer applies each of those tests to its proportionate interest in the indirect acquisition of the business;  if the amount of time between the separate acquisitions is such that the effect of the first acquisition is not adequately reflected in the results of the business or related businesses the issuer is acquiring. Financial statements or other information (6) Paragraphs 35. 5(2)(b) and 35.6 (2)(b) discuss financial statements or other information for the acquired business or related businesses. This other information is intended to capture the financial information disclosures required under Part 8 of NI 51-102 other than financial statements. An example of other information would include the operating statements, property descriptions, production volumes and reserves disclosures described under section 8.10 of NI 51-102 .(7) Section 3.11 of NI 52-107 permits acquisition statements included in a business acquisition report or prospectus to be prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP applicable to private enterprises in certain circumstances. The ability to present acquisition statements using Canadian GAAP applicable to private enterprises would not extend to a situation where an entity acquired or to be acquired is considered the primary business or the predecessor of the issuer and the issuer must provide financial statements for this acquisition under Item 32.

{"metadata":"9979","text":"(1) The financial statements for acquisitions of a predecessor entity, a business or businesses acquired by the issuer, or other entity must be included in the prospectus under Item 32 of Form 41-101F 1, if the entities or businesses satisfy the conditions of paragraph 32.1 (1)(a), (b), or (c) unless, as contemplated in subsection 32.1 (2) with respect to paragraph 32.1 (1)(a) or (b) (a) the issuer was a reporting issuer in any jurisdiction of Canada on the acquisition date in the case of a completed acquisition or immediately prior to the prospectus filing in the case of a proposed acquisition, (b) the issuer did not have only cash, cash equivalents or an exchange listing as its principal asset, and (c) the issuer provides disclosure under Item 35 of Form 41-101F1 . The disclosure requirements applicable to a reporting issuer in Item 35 are intended to reflect the requirements that would be prescribed for such acquisitions in the reporting issuer's business acquisition report. (2) An issuer that is subject to Item 32 must also consider the necessity of including pro forma financial statements pursuant to section 32.7 of Form 41-101F1 to illustrate the impact of the acquisition on the issuer's financial position and results of operations. However, these pro forma financial statements are only required if their inclusion is necessary for the prospectus to contain full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities being distributed. Examples of when pro forma financial statements would likely be necessary are in cases where: (a) the issuer has acquired multiple businesses over the relevant period; or (b) the issuer has an active business and has acquired another business that will constitute its primary business going forward. In certain circumstances, an issuer may need to disclose multiple acquisitions in its prospectus where the acquisitions include an acquisition of a primary business or predecessor entity to which section 32.1 of Form 41-101F1 applies and a significant acquisition to which only item 35 of Form 41-101F1 applies. In this case, the issuer may wish to present one set of pro forma financial statements reflecting the results of all of the acquisitions, as contemplated separately in each of sections 32.8 and 35.7 of Form 41-101F1. The securities regulatory authority or regulator would not generally object to providing this relief. However the issuer must request the relief when filing its preliminary prospectus.

{"metadata":"9983","text":"(1) Significant Acquisitions. Subject to subsection (3) and subsections 8.10 (1) and 8.10 (2), an acquisition of a business or related businesses is a significant acquisition, (a) for a reporting issuer that is not a venture issuer, if the acquisition satisfies any of the three significance tests set out in subsection (2); and (b) for a venture issuer, if the acquisition satisfies either of the significance tests set out in paragraphs (2)(a) or (b) if 20 percent is read as 100 percent. (2) Required Significance Tests. For the purposes of subsection (1) and subject to subsections (4.1) and (4.2), the significance tests are: (a) The Asset Test . The reporting issuer's proportionate share of the consolidated assets of the business or related businesses exceeds 20 percent of the consolidated assets of the reporting issuer calculated using the audited annual financial statements of each of the reporting issuer and the business or the related businesses for the most recently completed financial year of each that ended before the acquisition date. (b) The Investment Test . The reporting issuer's consolidated investments in and advances to the business or related businesses as at the acquisition date exceeds 20 percent of the consolidated assets of the reporting issuer as at the last day of the most recently completed financial year of the reporting issuer ended before the acquisition date, excluding any investments in or advances to the business or related businesses as at that date. (c) The Profit or Loss Test . The reporting issuer's proportionate share of the consolidated specified profit or loss of the business or related businesses exceeds 20 percent of the consolidated specified profit or loss of the reporting issuer calculated using the audited annual financial statements of each of the reporting issuer and the business or related businesses for the most recently completed financial year of each ended before the acquisition date. (3) Optional Significance Tests. Despite subsection (1) and subject to subsections 8.10 (1) and 8.10 (2), if an acquisition of a business or related businesses is significant based on the significance tests in subsection (2), (a) a reporting issuer that is not a venture issuer may re-calculate the significance using the optional significance tests in subsection (4); and (b) a venture issuer may re-calculate the significance using the optional significance tests in paragraphs (4)(a) or (b) if 20 percent is read as 100 percent. (4) For the purposes of subsection (3) and subject to subsections (4.1) and (4.2), the optional significance tests are: (a) The Asset Test . The reporting issuer's proportionate share of the consolidated assets of the business or related businesses exceeds 20 percent of the consolidated assets of the reporting issuer, calculated using the financial statements of each of the reporting issuer and the business or the related businesses for the most recently completed interim period or financial year of each, without giving effect to the acquisition. (b) The Investment Test . The reporting issuer's consolidated investments in and advances to the business or related businesses as at the acquisition date exceeds 20 percent of the consolidated assets of the reporting issuer as at the last day of the most recently completed interim period or financial year of the reporting issuer, excluding any investments in or advances to the business or related businesses as at that date. (c) The Profit or Loss Test . The specified profit or loss calculated under the following subparagraph (i) exceeds 20 percent of the specified profit or loss calculated under the following subparagraph (ii): (i) the reporting issuer's proportionate share of the consolidated specified profit or loss of the business or related businesses for the later of (A) the most recently completed financial year of the business or related businesses; or (B) the 12 months ended on the last day of the most recently completed interim period of the business or related businesses; (ii) the reporting issuer's consolidated specified profit or loss for the later of (A) the most recently completed financial year, without giving effect to the acquisition; or (B) the 12 months ended on the last day of the most recently completed interim period of the reporting issuer, without giving effect to the acquisition. (4.1) For the purposes of subsections (2) and (4), the reporting issuer must not remeasure its previously held equity interest in the business or related businesses.(4.2) For the purposes of paragraphs (2)(b) and (4)(b), the reporting issuer's investments in and advances to the business or related businesses must include (a) the consideration transferred for the acquisition, measured in accordance with the issuer's gaap (b) payments made in connection with the acquisition which do not constitute consideration transferred but which would not have been paid unless the acquisition had occurred, and (c) contingent consideration for the acquisition measured in accordance with the issuer's GAAP. (5) If an acquisition does not meet any of the significance tests under subsection (4), the acquisition is not a significant acquisition.(6) Despite subsection (3), the significance of an acquisition of a business or related businesses may be re-calculated using financial statements for periods that ended after the acquisition date only if, after the acquisition date, the business or related businesses remained substantially intact and were not significantly reorganized, and no significant assets or liabilities were transferred to other entities.(7) Application of the Profit or Loss Test if a Loss Occurred. For the purposes of paragraphs (2)(c) and (4)(c), if any of the reporting issuer, the business or the related businesses has incurred a loss, the significance test must be applied using the absolute value of the loss from continuing operations attributable to owners of the parent, adjusted to exclude income taxes.(8) Application of the Profit or Loss Test if Lower Than Average Profit or Loss for the Most Recent Year. For the purposes of paragraph (2)(c) and clause (4)(c)(ii)(A), if the reporting issuer's consolidated specified profit or loss for the most recently completed financial year was lower by 20 percent or more than its average consolidated specified profit or loss for the three most recently completed financial years, the issuer may, subject to subsection (10), substitute the average consolidated specified profit or loss for the three most recently completed financial years in determining whether the significance test set out in paragraph (2)(c) or (4)(c) is satisfied.(9) Application of the Optional Profit or Loss Test if Lower Than Average Profit or Loss for the Most Recent Year. For the purpose of clause (4)(c)(ii)(B) if the reporting issuer's consolidated specified profit or loss for the most recently completed 12-month period was lower by 20 percent or more than its average consolidated specified profit or loss for the three most recently completed 12-month periods, the issuer may, subject to subsection (10), substitute the average consolidated specified profit or loss for the three most recently completed 12-month periods in determining whether the significance test set out in paragraph (4)(c) is satisfied.(10) Lower than Average Profit or Loss of the Issuer if a Loss Occurred. If the reporting issuer's consolidated specified profit or loss for either of the two earlier financial periods referred to in subsections (8) and (9) is a loss, the reporting issuer's specified profit or loss for that period is considered to be zero for the purposes of calculating the average consolidated specified profit or loss for the three financial periods.(11) Application of Significance Tests—Multiple Investments in the Same Business. If a reporting issuer has made multiple investments in the same business, then for the purposes of applying subsections (2) and (4), (a) if the initial investment and one or more incremental investments were made during the same financial year, the investments must be aggregated and tested on a combined basis; (b) if one or more incremental investments were made in a financial year subsequent to the financial year in which an initial or incremental investment was made and the initial or previous incremental investments are reflected in audited annual financial statements of the reporting issuer previously filed, the reporting issuer must apply the significance tests set out in subsections (2) and (4) on a combined basis to the incremental investments not reflected in audited financial statements of the reporting issuer previously filed; and (c) if one or more incremental investments were made in a financial year subsequent to the financial year in which the initial investment was made and the initial investment is not reflected in audited annual financial statements of the reporting issuer previously filed, the reporting issuer must apply the significance tests set out in subsections (2) and (4) to the initial and incremental investments on a combined basis. (11.1) Application of the Optional Profit or Loss Test based on Pro Forma Financial Information. For the purposes of calculating the optional profit or loss test under clause (4)(c)(ii)(A), a reporting issuer may use pro forma consolidated specified profit or loss for its most recently completed financial year that was included in a previously filed document if (a) the reporting issuer has made a significant acquisition of a business after its most recently completed financial year; and (b) the previously filed document included (i) audited annual financial statements of that acquired business for the periods required by this Part; and (ii) the pro forma financial information required by subsection 8.4 (5) or (6). (12) Application of Significance Tests—Related Businesses. In determining whether an acquisition of related businesses is a significant acquisition, related businesses acquired after the ending date of the most recently filed audited annual financial statements of the reporting issuer must be considered on a combined basis.(13) Application of Significance Tests—Accounting Principles and Currency. For the purposes of calculating the significance tests in subsections (2) and (4), the amounts used for the business or related businesses must (a) subject to subsection (13.1), be based on the issuer's GAAP, and (b) be translated into the same presentation currency as that used in the reporting issuer's financial statements. (13.1) Application of Significance Tests—Exemption—Canadian GAAP Applicable to Private Enterprises. Paragraph 8.3(13)(a) does not apply to a venture issuer if (a) the financial statements for the business or related businesses referred to in subsections 8.3(2) and (4) (i) are prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP applicable to private enterprises, and (ii) are prepared in a manner that consolidates any subsidiaries and accounts for significantly influenced investees and joint ventures using the equity method; and (b) none of the accounting principles described in paragraphs 3.11 (1)(a) through (e) of National Instrument 52-107 Acceptable Accounting Principles and Auditing Standards were used to prepare financial statements for the business or related businesses referred to in subsections 8.3(2) and (4). (14) Application of Significance Tests—Use of Unaudited Financial Statements. subsections (2) and (4), the significance of an acquisition of a business or related businesses may be calculated using unaudited financial statements of the business or related businesses that comply with section 3.11 of National Instrument 52-107 Acceptable Accounting Principles and Auditing Standards if the financial statements of the business or related businesses for the most recently completed financial year have not been audited.(15) Application of Significance Tests—Use of Previous Audited Financial Statements. Despite subsections (2) and (4), the significance of an acquisition of a business or related businesses may be calculated using the audited financial statements for the financial year immediately preceding the reporting issuer's most recently completed financial year if the reporting issuer has not been required to file, and has not filed, audited financial statements for its most recently completed financial year.

At what stage in the prospectus process should the prospectus be pre-filed? To use the pre-file process, we expect the terms and conditions of the offering, and any related transactions, to be clearly determined. We also expect that the underwriters would have substantially completed their review of the pre-filed prospectus. Staff expect the pre-filed prospectus generally to be of the same form and quality as if it was the publicly filed preliminary prospectus, and contain the disclosure (including financial statements) prescribed under securities legislation and described in the form of prospectus that the issuer intends to use. ...If staff determine that the pre-filed prospectus is materially non-compliant or incomplete, the principal regulator will stop the review and ask the filer to file a revised draft with the necessary information. This will likely delay the review. In the event staff do not receive a response within a reasonable period of time, they may advise the filer that the pre-file will be closed unless a response to the request for information or comment letter is received by a specified date. Staff will consider the pre-filing to be withdrawn if there is no response within 90 days of the initial pre-filing date.

{"metadata":"12346","text":"(1) It is not unusual for analysts to ask corporate officers to review earnings estimates that they are preparing. A company takes on a high degree of risk of violating securities legislation if it selectively confirms that an analyst's estimate is on target or that an analyst's estimate is too high or too low, whether directly or indirectly through implied guidance. [FN 34](2) Even when confirming information previously made public, a company needs to consider whether the selective confirmation itself communicates information above and beyond the initial forecast and whether the additional information is material. This will depend in large part on how much time has passed between the original statement and the company's confirmation, as well as the timing of the two statements relative to the end of the company's fiscal period. For example, a selective confirmation of expected earnings near the end of a quarter is likely to represent guidance (as it may well be based on how the company actually performed). Materiality of a confirmation may also depend on intervening events. [FN 35](3) One way companies can try to ensure that analyst's estimates are in line with their own expectations is through the regular and timely public dissemination of qualitative and quantitative information. The better the marketplace is informed, the less likely it is that analysts' estimates will deviate significantly from a company's own expectations. FN 34 This position follows the position adopted by the SEC in the adopting release to Regulation FD and the position taken by the Australian Securities &; Investments Commission in its guidance note Better Disclosure for Investors (http://www.asic.gov.au).

Having your board or audit committee review such disclosure in advance of its public release acts as a good discipline on management and helps to increase the quality, credibility and objectivity of such disclosures. This review process also helps to force a critical examination of all issues related to the disclosure and reduces the risk of having to make subsequent adjustments or amendments to the information it contains.(2) Where feasible, issue your earnings news release [FN 39] concurrently with the filing of your quarterly or annual financial statements. This will help to ensure that a complete financial picture is available to analysts and investors at the time the earnings release is provided. Coordinating the release of a company's earnings information with the filing of its quarterly or annual financial statements will also facilitate review of these disclosures by the board or audit committee of the company. [FN 40] FN 38 Some provinces require that annual financial statements be reviewed by a company's audit committee (if the company has an audit committee) before board approval. A board of directors must also review interim financial statements before they are filed and distributed. In the case of interim financial statements, boards are permitted to delegate this review function to the audit committee (see for example, OSC Rule 52-501 Financial Statements). Where such a requirement exists at law, we believe that extracting information from financial statements that have not been reviewed by the board or audit committee and releasing that information to the marketplace in a news release is inconsistent with the prior review requirement. FN 39 Companies often issue news releases announcing corporate earnings which highlight major items and may include pro forma results. FN 40 Certain jurisdictions impose a requirement to concurrently deliver to shareholders financial statements that are filed. This may militate against the early filing of annual financial statements to avoid the cost of mailing them twice, once at the time of early filing and subsequently as part of the company's annual report. The CSA is considering eliminating this concurrent delivery obligation in the context of harmonizing continuous disclosure requirements across the country.

A reporting issuer may determine that its obligation to provide full, true and plain disclosure obliges it to include in its prospectus reserves data and other oil and gas information as at a date more recent than specified in the prospectus requirements. The prospectus requirements state that the information must be as at the reporting issuer's most recent financial year-end in respect of which the prospectus includes financial statements. CSA staff may consider granting relief on a case-by-case basis to permit a reporting issuer in these circumstances to include in its prospectus the oil and gas information prepared with an effective date more recent than the financial yearend date, without also including the corresponding information effective as at the year-end date. A consideration for granting this relief may include disclosure of Form 51-101F1 information with an effective date that coincides with the date of interim financial statements.

While NI 51-102 does not require an issuer to engage its auditor to review its interim financial report, it does however require an issuer to disclose in an accompanying notice if an interim review has not been performed by its auditor. We found a significant level of non-compliance with this disclosure requirement and in these cases, issuers were requested to refile their interim financial statements with the required disclosure.The purpose of this notice is to summarize the results of our review and to clarify the securities law requirements relating to an auditor's involvement with interim financial reports. As well, we have provided further guidance on the review requirements for an issuer's first interim financial report prepared following its transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Issuers and their advisors should take this notice into account when assessing the extent to which future disclosure meets the requirements of securities legislation and their investors' need for transparent disclosure. Investors need to be properly informed about an auditor's level of involvement with an issuer's interim financial report given that auditor involvement levels will continue to vary amongst issuers.

This disclosure is important as it alerts investors and other users of the financial statements that the issuer's auditor did not complete a review of the interim financial report. With this disclosure, users of financial statements are able to determine the amount of reliance they may place on an issuer's interim financial report when deciding to buy or sell investments throughout the year.

We asked these issuers to confirm that their interim financial statements had been reviewed in accordance with securities legislation and Section 7050 auditor review of interim financial statements (Section 7050) of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants Handbook (the Handbook).Overall, we found that 35% of the issuers reviewed, consisting of four non-venture and 21 venture issuers, did not comply with the disclosure requirements relating to an auditor's involvement with interim financial statements. Specifically, 48% of venture issuers and 14% of non-venture issuers selected, confirmed that an auditor did not perform a review of its interim financial statements and yet these statements were not accompanied by a notice indicating that fact. Given the importance of this information to investors, we requested that these issuers refile their third quarter interim financial statements with the disclosure that its previously filed interim financial statements were not reviewed by its auditor. The reasons cited for noncompliance by issuers included a general lack of awareness about their disclosure obligations or confusion about what would constitute a review under securities legislation and Section 7050 of the Handbook. To improve the level of compliance going forward, we have highlighted below the relevant securities law requirements relating to an auditor's involvement with interim financial reports.

{"metadata":"12485","text":"An issuer is not required to engage its auditor to review its interim financial report for the purposes of fulfilling its continuous disclosure obligations under NI 51-102. As depicted in the chart below however, subsection 4.3(3) of NI 51-102 requires a reporting issuer to disclose if an auditor has not performed a review of the interim financial report, to disclose if an auditor was unable to complete a review and why, and to file a written report from the auditor if the auditor has performed a review and expressed a reservation in the auditor's interim review report. As the white box in the chart shows, the only time that disclosure is not required is when an auditor has performed a review and has not expressed a reservation in the auditor's interim review report. The term “review” refers to a review engagement where the auditor reports to the issuer's audit committee on the results of a review of the issuer's interim financial report for all of the periods presented in the report and in accordance with Section 7050 of the Handbook. (If a reporting issuer's financial statements are audited in accordance with auditing standards other than Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, the corresponding review standards should be applied.) Where an auditor has been retained to perform limited review procedures or to review only certain components of an issuer's interim financial report, this would not constitute a “review” and we would require disclosure of a notice indicating that the interim financial report has not been reviewed by the auditor. While NI 51-102 does not prescribe the format of this notice, issuers typically provide this disclosure on a separate page appearing immediately before the interim financial report.

Therefore, for the first IFRS interim financial report this review will have to include, in addition to the current and comparative period results, the opening IFRS statement of financial position and all IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards reconciliations presented in the notes. To the extent a review of all components of the interim financial report is not completed, the interim financial report will need to be accompanied by a notice indicating that it has not been reviewed by the issuer's auditor.

Auditors may also wish to consider how an issuer is communicating their level of involvement with the interim financial report given that an omission of disclosure implies that the report has been reviewed when a review engagement may not have been performed. We believe that investors need to be able to discern the level of auditor involvement in an issuer's interim financial report when making investment decisions, and as such, staff will continue to request re-filings of this report when an issuer has not met its disclosure obligations in this area.

A reporting issuer should disclose and discuss material differences for material individual items included in the FOFI or financial outlook, including assumptions.For example, if the actual dollar amount of revenue approximates forecasted revenue but the sales mix or sales volume differs materially from what the reporting issuer expected, the reporting issuer should explain the differences.(3) Subsection 5.8(5) of the Instrument addresses a reporting issuer's decision to withdraw previously disclosed material forward-looking information. The subsection requires the reporting issuer to disclose that decision and discuss the events and circumstances that led the reporting issuer to the decision to withdraw the material forward-looking information, including a discussion of the assumptions included in the material forward-looking information that are no longer valid. A reporting issuer should consider whether the events and circumstances that trigger md&a disclosure under subsection 5.8(5) of the Instrument might also trigger material change reporting requirements under Part 7 of the Instrument. We encourage all reporting issuers to promptly communicate to the market a decision to withdraw material forward-looking information, even if the material change reporting requirements are not triggered.

However, to meet the requirements of section 2.2.1 of Form 51-102F1 , the venture issuer should disclose in its quarterly highlights any change, if material, from plans disclosed in the annual md&a. For example, if a mining issuer discloses a drill program in its annual md&a and decides to make a change to that drill program in a subsequent interim period, that change, if material, should be disclosed in the quarterly highlights for that period.(2) Although all venture issuers have the option of providing quarterly highlights, there are some instances where a venture issuer may want to consider providing full interim md&a instead of quarterly highlights. We believe the option to use quarterly highlights will likely satisfy the needs of investors in smaller venture issuers. However, investors in larger venture issuers, including those with significant revenue, may want full interim md&a to assist them in making informed investment decisions. Issuers will likely take the needs of their investors into consideration when determining whether to provide quarterly highlights or full interim md&a.(3) For greater certainty, a reference to interim md&a is a reference to the quarterly highlights a venture issuer has the option of providing in accordance with section 2.2.1 of Form 51-102F1 .

This certification is not qualified by the phrase in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which is typically included in audit reports accompanying annual financial statements.

Delegation Permitted in Certain Cases"},
{"metadata":"12671","text":"(1) Approaches to consider for design - The Instrument does not prescribe the approach certifying officers should use to design the issuer's DC&P or ICFR. However, we believe that a top-down, risk-based approach is an efficient and cost-effective approach that certifying officers should consider. This approach allows certifying officers to avoid unnecessary time and effort designing components of DC&P and ICFR that are not required to obtain reasonable assurance. Alternatively, certifying officers might use some other approach to design, depending on the issuer's size, nature of business and complexity of operations. (2) Top-down, risk-based approach - Under a top-down, risk-based approach to designing DC&P and ICFR certifying officers first identify and assess risks faced by the issuer in order to determine the scope and necessary complexity of the issuer's DC&P or ICFR. A top-down, risk- based approach helps certifying officers to focus their resources on the areas of greatest risk and avoid expending unnecessary resources on areas with little or no risk. Under a top-down, risk-based approach, certifying officers initially consider risks without considering any existing controls of the issuer. Using this approach to design DC&P, the certifying officers identify the risks that could, individually or in combination with others, reasonably result in a material misstatement in its annual filings, interim filings or other reports filed or submitted by it under securities legislation. Using this approach to design ICFR, the certifying officers identify those risks that could, individually or in combination with others, reasonably result in a material misstatement of the financial statements (financial reporting risks). A material misstatement includes misstatements due to error, fraud or omission in disclosure. Identifying risks involves considering the size and nature of the issuer's business and the structure and complexity of business operations. If an issuer has multiple locations or business units, certifying officers initially identify the risks that could reasonably result in a material misstatement and then consider the significance of these risks at individual locations or business units. If the officers identify a risk that could reasonably result in a material misstatement, but the risk is either adequately addressed by controls, policies or procedures that operate centrally or is not present at an individual location or business unit, then certifying officers do not need to focus their resources at that location or business unit to address the risk. For the design of DC&P, the certifying officers assess risks for various types and methods of disclosure. For the design of ICFR, identifying risks involves identifying significant accounts and disclosures and their relevant assertions. After identifying risks that could reasonably result in a material misstatement, the certifying officers then ensure that the DC&P and ICFR designs include controls, policies and procedures to address each of the identified risks. (3) Fraud risk - When identifying risks, certifying officers should explicitly consider the vulnerability of the entity to fraudulent activity (e.g., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets). Certifying officers should consider how incentives (e.g., compensation programs) and pressures (e.g., meeting analysts' expectations) might affect risks, and what areas of the business provide opportunity for an individual to commit fraud. For the purposes of this Instrument, fraud would generally include an intentional act by one or more individuals among management, other employees, those charged with governance or third parties, involving the use of deception to obtain an unjust or illegal advantage. Although fraud is a broad legal concept, for the purposes of this Instrument, the certifying officers should be concerned with fraud that could cause a material misstatement in the issuer's annual filings, interim filings or other reports filed or submitted under securities legislation. (4) Designing controls, policies and procedures - If the certifying officers choose to use a top-down, risk-based approach, they design specific controls, policies and procedures that, in combination with an issuer's control environment, appropriately address the risks discussed in subsections (2) and (3). If certifying officers choose to use an approach other than a top-down, risk-based approach, they should still consider whether the combination of the components of DC&P and ICFR that they have designed are a sufficient basis for the representations about reasonable assurance required in paragraph 5 of the certificates. Risk Considerations For Designing DC&P and ICFR"},
{"metadata":"12672","text":"(1) Importance of control environment - An issuer's control environment is the foundation upon which all other components of DC&P and ICFR are based and influences the tone of an organization. An effective control environment contributes to the reliability of all other controls, processes and procedures by creating an atmosphere where errors or fraud are either less likely to occur, or if they occur, more likely to be detected. An effective control environment also supports the flow of information within the issuer, thus promoting compliance with an issuer's disclosure policies. An effective control environment alone will not provide reasonable assurance that any of the risks identified will be addressed and managed. An ineffective control environment, however, can undermine an issuer's controls, policies and procedures designed to address specific risks. (2) Elements of a control environment - A key element of an issuer's control environment is the attitude towards controls demonstrated by the board of directors, audit committee and senior management through their direction and actions in the organization. An appropriate tone at the top can help to develop a culture of integrity and accountability at all levels of an organization which support other components of DC&P and ICFR. The tone at the top should be reinforced on an ongoing basis by those accountable for the organization's DC&P and ICFR. In addition to an appropriate tone at the top, certifying officers should consider the following elements of an issuer's control environment: (a) organizational structure of the issuer - a structure which relies on established and documented lines of authority and responsibility may be appropriate for some issuers, whereas a structure which allows employees to communicate informally with each other at all levels may be more appropriate for some issuers; (b) management's philosophy and operating style - a philosophy and style that emphasises managing risks with appropriate diligence and demonstrates receptiveness to negative as well as positive information will foster a stronger control environment; (c) integrity, ethics, and competence of personnel -controls, policies and procedures are more likely to be effective if they are carried out by ethical, competent and adequately supervised employees; (d) external influences that affect the issuer's operations and risk management practices - these could include global business practices, regulatory supervision, insurance coverage and legislative requirements; and (e) human resources policies and procedures - an issuer's hiring, training, supervision, compensation, termination and evaluation practices can affect the quality of the issuer's workforce and its employees' attitudes towards controls. (3) Sources of information about the control environment - The following documentation might provide useful information about an issuer's control environment: (a) written codes of conduct or ethics policies; (b) procedure manuals, operating instructions, job descriptions and training materials; (c) evidence that employees have confirmed their knowledge and understanding of items (a) and (b); (d) organizational charts that identify approval structures and the flow of information; and (e) written correspondence provided by an issuer's external auditor regarding the issuer's control environment. Control Environment"},
{"metadata":"12673","text":"In order for DC&P to provide reasonable assurance that information required by securities legislation to be disclosed by an issuer is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods, DC&P should generally include the following components: (a) written communication to an issuer's employees and directors of the issuer's disclosure obligations, including the purpose of disclosure and DC&P and deadlines for specific filings and other disclosure; (b) assignment of roles, responsibilities and authorizations relating to disclosure; (c) guidance on how authorized individuals should assess and document the materiality of information or events for disclosure purposes; and (d) a policy on how the issuer will receive, document, evaluate and respond to complaints or concerns received from internal or external sources regarding financial reporting or other disclosure issues. An issuer might choose to include these components in a document called a disclosure policy. Part 6 of National Policy 51-201 Disclosure Standards encourages issuers to establish a written disclosure policy and discusses in more detail some of these components.

{"metadata":"12675","text":"(1) Significant accounts and disclosures and their relevant assertions - As described in subsection 6.6(2) of the Policy, a top-down, risk-based approach to designing ICFR involves identifying significant accounts and disclosures and the relevant assertions that affect each significant account and disclosure. This method assists certifying officers in identifying the risks that could reasonably result in a material misstatement in the issuer's financial statements and not all possible risks the issuer faces. (2) Identifying significant accounts and disclosures - A significant account could be an individual line item on the issuer's financial statements, or part of a line item. For example, an issuer might present net revenue, which represents a combination of gross revenue and returns, but might identify gross revenue as a significant account. By identifying part of a line item as a significant account, certifying officers might be able to focus on balances that are subject to specific risks that can be separately identified. A significant disclosure relating to the design of ICFR could be any form of disclosure included in the issuer's financial statements, or notes to the financial statements, that is presented in accordance with the issuer's GAAP. The identification of significant disclosures for the design of ICFR does not extend to the preparation of the issuer's MD&A or other similar financial information presented in a continuous disclosure filing other than financial statements. (3) Considerations for identifying significant accounts and disclosures - A minimum threshold expressed as a percentage or a dollar amount could provide a reasonable starting point for evaluating the significance of an account or disclosure. However, certifying officers should use their judgment, taking into account qualitative factors, to assess accounts or disclosures for significance above or below that threshold. The following factors will be relevant when determining whether an account or disclosure is significant: (a) the size, nature and composition of the account or disclosure; (b) the risk of overstatement or understatement of the account or disclosure; (c) the susceptibility to misstatement due to errors or fraud; (d) the volume of activity, complexity and homogeneity of the individual transactions processed through the account or reflected in the disclosure; (e) the accounting and reporting complexities associated with the account or disclosure; (f) the likelihood (or possibility) of conditions that will give rise to significant contingent liabilities in the account or disclosure; (g) the existence of related party transactions; and (h) the impact of the account on existing debt covenants. (4) Assertions - Using a top-down, risk-based approach, the certifying officers identify those assertions for each significant account and disclosure that presents a risk that could reasonably result in a material misstatement in that significant account or disclosure. For each significant account and disclosure the following assertions could be relevant: (a) existence or occurrence - whether assets or liabilities exist and whether transactions and events that have been recorded have occurred and pertain to the issuer; (b) completeness - whether all assets, liabilities and transactions that should have been recorded have been recorded; (c) valuation or allocation - whether assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses have been included in the financial statements at appropriate amounts and any resulting valuation or allocation adjustments are appropriately recorded; (d) rights and obligations - whether assets are legally owned by the issuer and liabilities are the obligations of the issuer; and (e) presentation and disclosure - whether particular components of the financial statements are appropriately presented and described and disclosures are clearly expressed. The certifying officers might consider assertions that differ from those listed above if the certifying officers determine that they have identified the pertinent risks in each significant account and disclosure that could reasonably result in a material misstatement. (5) Identifying relevant assertions for each significant account and disclosure - To identify relevant assertions for each significant account and disclosure, the certifying officers determine the source of potential misstatements for each significant account or disclosure. When determining whether a particular assertion is relevant, the certifying officers would consider the nature of the assertion, the volume of transactions or data related to the assertion and the complexity of the underlying systems supporting the assertion. If an assertion does not present a risk that could reasonably result in a material misstatement in a significant account, it is likely not a relevant assertion. For example, valuation might not be relevant to the cash account unless currency translation is involved; however, existence and completeness are always relevant. Similarly, valuation might not be relevant to the gross amount of the accounts receivable balance, but is relevant to the related allowance accounts. (6) Identifying controls, policies and procedures for relevant assertions - Using a top-down, risk- based approach, the certifying officers design components of ICFR to address each relevant assertion. The certifying officers do not need to design all possible components of ICFR to address each relevant assertion, but should identify and design an appropriate combination of controls, policies and procedures to address all relevant assertions. The certifying officers would consider the efficiency of evaluating an issuer's ICFR design when designing an appropriate combination of ICFR components. If more than one potential control, policy or procedure could address a relevant assertion, certifying officers could select the control, policy or procedure that would be easiest to evaluate (e.g., automated control vs. manual control). Similarly, if a control, policy or procedure can be designed to address more than one relevant assertion, then certifying officers could choose it rather than a control, policy or procedure that addresses only one relevant assertion. For example, the certifying officers would consider whether any entity-wide controls exist that adequately address more than one relevant assertion or improve the efficiency of evaluating operating effectiveness because such entity-wide controls negate the need to design and evaluate other components of ICFR at multiple locations or business units. When designing a combination of controls, policies and procedures, the certifying officers should also consider how the components in subsection 6.7(2) of the Policy interact with each other. For example, the certifying officers should consider how information technology general controls interact with controls, policies and procedures over initiating, authorizing, recording, processing and reporting transactions.

{"metadata":"12676","text":"Key features of ICFR and related design challenges are described below. (a) Segregation of duties - The term segregation of duties refers to one or more employees or procedures acting as a check and balance on the activities of another so that no one individual has control over all steps of processing a transaction or other activity. Assigning different people responsibility for authorizing transactions, recording transactions, reconciling information and maintaining custody of assets reduces the opportunity for any one employee to conceal errors or perpetrate fraud in the normal course of his or her duties. Segregating duties also increases the chance of discovering inadvertent errors early. If an issuer has few employees, a single employee may be authorized to initiate, approve and effect payment for transactions and it might be difficult to re-assign responsibilities to segregate those duties appropriately. (b) Board expertise - An effective board objectively reviews management's judgments and is actively engaged in shaping and monitoring the issuer's control environment. An issuer might find it challenging to attract directors with the appropriate financial reporting expertise, objectivity, time, ability and experience. (c) Controls over management override - An issuer might be dominated by a founder or other strong leader who exercises a great deal of discretion and provides personal direction to other employees. Although this type of individual can help an issuer meet its growth and other objectives, such concentration of knowledge and authority could allow the individual an opportunity to override established policies or procedures or otherwise reduce the likelihood of an effective control environment. (d) Qualified personnel - Sufficient accounting and financial reporting expertise is necessary to ensure reliable financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the issuer's GAAP. Some issuers might be unable to obtain qualified accounting personnel or outsourced expert advice on a cost-effective basis. Even if an issuer obtains outsourced expert advice, the issuer might not have the internal expertise to understand or assess the quality of the outsourced advice. If an issuer consults on technically complex accounting matters, this consultation alone is not indicative of a deficiency relating to the design of ICFR. An issuer's external auditor might perform certain services (e.g., income tax, valuation or internal audit services), where permitted by auditor independence rules, that provide skills which would otherwise be addressed by hiring qualified personnel or outsourcing expert advice from a party other than the external auditor. This type of arrangement should not be considered to be a component of the issuer's ICFR design. If an issuer identifies one or more of these ICFR design challenges, additional involvement by the issuer's audit committee or board of directors could be a suitable compensating control or alternatively could mitigate risks that exist as a result of being unable to remediate a material weakness relating to the design challenge. The control framework the certifying officers use to design ICFR could include further information on these design challenges. See section 9.1 of the Policy for a discussion of compensating controls versus mitigating procedures. ICFR Design Challenges"},

{"metadata":"12689","text":"(1) General - Reperformance is the independent execution of certain components of the issuer's DC&P or ICFR that were performed previously. Reperformance could include inspecting records whether internal (e.g., a purchase order prepared by the issuer's purchasing department) or external (e.g., a sales invoice prepared by a vendor), in paper form, electronic form or other media. The reliability of records varies depending on their nature, source and the effectiveness of controls over their production. An example of reperformance is inspecting whether the quantity and price information in a sales invoice agree with the quantity and price information in a purchase order, and confirming that an employee previously performed this procedure. (2) Extent of reperformance - The extent of reperformance of a component of DC&P or ICFR is a matter of judgment for the certifying officers, acting reasonably. Components that are performed more frequently (e.g., controls for recording revenue) will generally require more testing than components that are performed less frequently (e.g., controls for monthly bank reconciliations). Components that are manually operated will likely require more rigorous testing than automated controls. Certifying officers could determine that they do not have to test every individual step comprising a control in order to conclude that the overall control is operating effectively. (3) Reperformance for each evaluation - Certifying officers might find it appropriate to adjust the nature, extent and timing of reperformance for each evaluation.

Fair Presentation"},
{"metadata":"12714","text":"(1) Access to underlying entity - The nature of an issuer's interest in an underlying entity will affect the certifying officer's ability to design and evaluate the effectiveness of the controls, policies and procedures carried out by the underlying entity. Subsidiary - In the case of an issuer with an interest in a subsidiary, as the issuer controls the subsidiary, certifying officers will have sufficient access to the subsidiary to design and evaluate the effectiveness of the controls, policies and procedures carried out by the underlying entity. Proportionately consolidated entity or SPE - In the case of an issuer with an interest in a proportionately consolidated entity or a SPE, certifying officers might not always have sufficient access to the underlying entity to design and evaluate the effectiveness of the controls, policies and procedures carried out by the underlying entity. Whether the certifying officers have sufficient access to a proportionately consolidated entity or a SPE to design and evaluate the effectiveness of the controls, policies and procedures carried out by the underlying entity is a question of fact. The sufficiency of their access could depend on, among other things: (a) the issuer's percentage ownership of the underlying entity; (b) whether the other underlying entity owners are reporting issuers; (c) the nature of the relationship between the issuer and the operator of the underlying entity if the issuer is not the operator; (d) the terms of the agreement(s) governing the underlying entity; and (e) the date of creation of the underlying entity. Portfolio investment or equity investment - In the case of an issuer with a portfolio investment or an equity investment, certifying officers will generally not have sufficient access to the underlying entity to design and evaluate the effectiveness of the controls, policies and procedures carried out by the underlying entity. (2) Access to an underlying entity in certain indirect offering structures - In the case of certain indirect offering structures, including certain income trust and limited partnership offering structures, the issuer could have: (a) a significant equity interest in the underlying entity but not legally control the underlying entity, since legal control is retained by a third party (typically the party involved in establishing the indirect offering structure) or (b) an equity interest in an underlying entity that represents a significant asset of the issuer and results in the issuer providing the issuer's equity holders with separate audited annual financial statements and interim financial reports prepared in accordance with the same accounting principles as the issuer's financial statements. In these cases, we generally expect the trust indenture, limited partnership agreement or other constating documents to include appropriate terms ensuring the certifying officers will have sufficient access to the underlying entity to design and evaluate the effectiveness of the controls, policies and procedures carried out by the underlying entity. (3) Reasonable steps to design and evaluate - Certifying officers should take all reasonable steps to design and evaluate the effectiveness of the controls, policies and procedures carried out by the underlying entity that provide the certifying officers with a basis for the representations in the annual and interim certificates. However, it is left to the discretion of the certifying officers, acting reasonably, to determine what constitutes reasonable steps. If the certifying officers have access to the underlying entity to design the controls, policies and procedures discussed in subsection (2) and they are not satisfied with those controls, policies and procedures, the certifying officers should consider whether there exists a material weakness or a weakness in DC&P that is significant. (4) Disclosure of a scope limitation relating to a proportionately consolidated entity or SPE -A scope limitation exists if the certifying officers would not have a reasonable basis for making the representations in the annual or interim certificates because they do not have sufficient access to a proportionately consolidated entity or SPE, as applicable, to design and evaluate the controls, policies and procedures carried out by that underlying entity. When determining whether a scope limitation exists, certifying officers must initially consider whether one, or a combination of more than one, proportionately consolidated entity or SPE includes risks that could reasonably result in a material misstatement in the issuer's annual filings, interim filings or other reports. The certifying officers would consider such risks when the certifying officers first identify the risks faced by the issuer in order to determine the scope and necessary complexity of the issuer's DC&P or ICFR, as discussed in subsection 6.6(2) of the Policy. The certifying officers would disclose a scope limitation if one, or a combination of more than one, proportionately consolidated entity or SPE includes risks that could reasonably result in a material misstatement and the certifying officers do not have sufficient access to design and evaluate the controls, policies and procedures carried out by each underlying entity. The certifying officers would not disclose a scope limitation if a proportionately consolidated entity or SPE, individually or in combination with another such entity, does not include risks that could reasonably result in a material misstatement. The issuer must disclose in its MD&A a scope limitation and summary financial information about each underlying entity in accordance with section 3.3 of the Instrument. The summary financial information may be disclosed in aggregate or individually for each proportionately consolidated entity or SPE. Meaningful summary financial information about an underlying entity, or combination of underlying entities, that is the subject of a scope limitation would include: (a) revenue; (b) profit or loss before discontinued operations; (c) profit or loss for the period; and unless (i) the accounting principles used to prepare the financial statements of the underlying entity permit the preparation of its statement of financial position without classifying assets and liabilities between current and non-current, and (ii) the MD&A includes alternative meaningful financial information about the underlying entity, or combination of underlying entities, which is more appropriate to the underlying entity's industry, (d) current assets; (e) non-current assets; (f) current liabilities; and (g) non-current liabilities. Meaningful disclosure about an underlying entity that is the subject of a scope limitation would also include any contingent liabilities and commitments for the proportionately consolidated entity or SPE. (5) Limited access to the underlying entity of a portfolio investment or equity investment - Although the certifying officers may not have sufficient access to design and evaluate controls, policies and procedures carried out by the underlying entity of a portfolio investment or equity investment, the issuer's DC&P and ICFR should address the issuer's controls over its disclosure of material information relating to: (a) the carrying amount of the investment; (b) any dividends the issuer receives from the investment; (c) any impairment loss in the investment; and (d) if applicable, the issuer's share of any profit or loss from the equity investment. (6) Reliance on financial information of underlying entity - In most cases, certifying officers will have to rely on the financial information reported by a proportionately consolidated entity, SPE or the underlying entity of an equity investment. In order to certify an issuer's annual or interim filings that include information regarding the issuer's investment in these underlying entities, the certifying officers should perform the following minimum procedures: (a) ensure that the issuer receives the underlying entity's financial information on a timely basis; (b) review the underlying entity's financial information to determine whether it has been prepared in accordance with the issuer's GAAP; and (c) review the underlying entity's accounting policies and evaluate whether they conform to the issuer's accounting policies.

A: NI 51-102 does not include a direct requirement for md&a to be reviewed by an issuer's auditor. However, under CICA Handbook section 7500 Auditor association with annual reports, interim reports and other public documents, an auditor is deemed to be associated with md&a corresponding to annual financial statements on which the auditor has issued an auditor's report. Also, an auditor is deemed to be associated with interim md&a if the auditor has been engaged to audit or review the corresponding interim financial statements.If an auditor is deemed to be associated with md&a, the auditor must perform the procedures specified in section 7500 of the Handbook. The auditor's specific aims when performing those procedures are to: (a) determine whether the financial statements, and when applicable, the report of the auditor, have been accurately reproduced; and (b) consider whether any of the other information in the document raises questions regarding, or appears to be otherwise inconsistent with, the financial statements.Handbook section 7500 specifies that the auditor should arrange to obtain the md&a prior to its release and perform the procedures set out in the section. Further, when circumstances prevent the auditor from obtaining the md&a prior to its release, the auditor should perform the procedures required by Handbook as soon as possible after its release, and consider advising the audit committee of the circumstances.If the reporting issuer's annual financial statements are audited in accordance with auditing standards other than Canadian GAAS, then the auditor's association with, and the requirement for procedures relating to, annual and interim md&a would be determined by those other auditing standards. re auditor review of MD&A"},

For example, although the notes to the financial statements may include information about contractual obligations, Form 51-102F1 requires an issuer that is not a venture issuer to include in the md&a a summary, in tabular form, of contractual obligations. In this example a cross-reference would not meet the Form 51-102F1 requirement.Issuers should use their judgment to ensure the md&a complements and supplements the financial statements.

{"metadata":"12848","text":" Interim md&a must update your company's annual md&a for all disclosure required by Item 1 except section 1.3. This disclosure must include (a) a discussion of your analysis of (i) current quarter and year-to-date results including a comparison of financial performance to the corresponding periods in the previous year; (i.i) a comparison of cash flows to the corresponding period in the previous year; (ii) changes in financial performance and elements of profit or loss attributable to owners of the parent that are not related to ongoing business operations; (iii) any seasonal aspects of your company's business that affect its financial position, financial performance or cash flows; and (b) a comparison of your company's interim financial condition to your company's financial condition as at the most recently completed financial year-end. INSTRUCTION (i) If the first md&a you file in this Form (your first md&a) is an interim md&a, you must provide all the disclosure called for in Item 1 in your first md&a. Base the disclosure, except the disclosure for section 1.3 , on your interim financial report. Since you do not have to update the disclosure required in section 1.3 in your interim md&a, your first md&a will provide disclosure under section 1.3 based on your annual financial statements. Your subsequent interim md&a for that year will update your first interim md&a. (ii) For the purposes of paragraph 2.2(b), you may assume the reader has access to your annual md&a or your first md&a. You do not have to duplicate the discussion and analysis of financial condition in your annual md&a or your first md&a. For example, if economic and industry factors are substantially unchanged you may make a statement to this effect. (iii) For the purposes of subparagraph 2.2(a)(i), you should generally give prominence to the current quarter. (iv) In discussing your company's statement of financial position conditions or profit or loss or cash flow items for an interim period, you do not have to present a summary, in tabular form, of all known contractual obligations contemplated under section 1.6 . Instead, you should disclose material changes in the specified contractual obligations during the interim period. (v) Interim md&a prepared in accordance with Item 2 is not required for your company's fourth quarter as relevant fourth quarter content will be contained in your company's annual md&a prepared in accordance with Item 1 (see section 1.10). (vi) In your interim md&a, update the summary of quarterly results in section 1.5 by providing summary information for the eight most recently completed quarters. (vii) Your annual md&a may not include all the information in Item 1 if you were a venture issuer as at the end of your last financial year. If you ceased to be a venture issuer during your interim period, you do not have to restate the md&a you previously filed. Instead, provide the disclosure for the additional sections in Item 1 that you were exempt from as a venture issuer in the next interim md&a you file. Base your disclosure for those sections on your interim financial report. 2.2.1 Quarterly Highlights If your company is a venture issuer, you have the option of meeting the requirement to provide interim md&a under section 2.2 by instead providing a short discussion of all material information about your company's operations, liquidity and capital resources. Include in your discussion: an analysis of your company's financial condition, financial performance and cash flows and any significant factors that have caused period to period variations in those measures; known trends, risks or demands; * major operating milestones; commitments, expected or unexpected events, or uncertainties that have materially affected your company's operations, liquidity and capital resources in the interim period or are reasonably likely to have a material effect going forward; any significant changes from disclosure previously made about how the company was going to use proceeds from any financing and an explanation of variances;  any significant transactions between related parties that occurred in the interim period. INSTRUCTIONS (i) If the first md&a you file in this Form (your first md&a) is an interim md&a, you cannot use quarterly highlights. Rather, you must provide all the disclosure called for in Item 1 in your first md&a. Base the disclosure, except the disclosure for section 1.3 , on your interim financial report. Since you do not have to update the disclosure required in section 1.3 in your interim md&a, your first md&a will provide disclosure under section 1.3 based on your annual financial statements. (ii) Provide a short, focused discussion that gives a balanced and accurate picture of the company's business activities during the interim period. The purpose of the quarterly highlights reporting is to provide a brief narrative update about the business activities, financial condition, financial performance and cash flow of the company. While summaries are to be clear and concise, they are subject to the normal prohibitions against false and misleading statements. (iii) Quarterly highlights prepared in accordance with section 2.2.1 are not required for your company's fourth quarter as relevant fourth quarter content will be contained in your company's annual md&a prepared in accordance with Item 1 (see section 1.10). (iv) You must title your quarterly highlights Interim md&a - Quarterly Highlights. (v) If there was a change to the company's accounting policies during the interim period, include a description of the material effects resulting from the change. 2.2.2 Quarterly Highlights - Transition Section 2.2.1 applies to an issuer in respect of a financial year beginning on or after July 1, 2015.
