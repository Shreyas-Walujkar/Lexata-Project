{"metadata":"11605###ngfm","text":"Misleading disclosure still prohibited: Compliance with the Instrument does not relieve an issuer from other obligations under securities legislation. Specifically, an issuer may not present or disclose a specified financial measure in a way that would be misleading."}
{"metadata":"11606###ngfm","text":"Definition of a non-GAAP financial measure: Common terms used to identify non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted earnings, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, pro forma earnings, cash earnings, distributable cash, adjusted funds from operations, earnings before non-recurring items and measures presented on a constant-currency basis. Many of these terms lack standard meanings. Issuers across a spectrum of industries, and within the same industry, may use the same term to refer to different compositions.The following are examples of measures that are not captured by the definition: Amounts that do not depict historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flow, which relate to elements of the primary financial statements as defined in the Instrument, such as share price, market capitalization, or credit rating; Financial information that does not have the effect of providing a financial measure that is different from a financial measure presented in the primary financial statements, such as the addition or subtraction of an identical line item, or a subtotal or total originating from multiple periods of primary financial statements. For example, rolling 12-month results or fourth quarter revenue calculated by subtracting year-to-date third quarter revenue from the annual revenue presented in primary financial statements; or A financial measure which does not exclude an amount that is included in, or include an amount that is excluded from, the composition of the most directly comparable financial measure presented in the primary financial statements of the entity. For example, assets under management representing the total market value of invested assets managed by the issuer which are beneficially owned by clients and not reported in the primary financial statements of the issuer. Component Information When an issuer presents a financial statement line item in a more granular way outside the financial statements, otherwise known as a disaggregation, that number is a component of a line item that has been calculated in accordance with the accounting policies used to prepare the line item presented in the financial statements. Such a financial measure would not be a non-GAAP financial measure because it is not a financial measure which excludes an amount that is included in, or includes an amount that is excluded from, the composition of the most directly comparable financial measure presented in the primary financial statements of the entity. However, even though such a measure would not be a non-GAAP financial measure, it may still meet the definition of a supplementary financial measure.For example, an issuer may disclose sales per square foot on a periodic basis to depict its financial performance. When the sales figure, included in sales per square foot, is extracted directly from the primary financial statements or is a component of such line item (when the component is calculated in accordance with the issuer's accounting policies used to prepare the line item presented in the financial statements), the sales per square foot measure would not meet the definition of a non-GAAP ratio but would meet the definition of a supplementary financial measure. However, if the sales figure is not calculated in accordance with the issuer's accounting policies, the sales per square foot measure in this example would meet the definition of a non-GAAP ratio. Combinations of Line Items A financial measure calculated by combining financial information that originates from different line items from the primary financial statements would meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure if the measure depicts financial performance, financial position or cash flow, unless that resulting measure is separately disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures that are Forward-looking Information Forward-looking information for which there is an equivalent historical financial measure disclosed in the financial statements does not meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Therefore, section 7 of the Instrument does not apply to measures such as future capital management measures and future total of segments measures.In addition, if, for example, revenue is disclosed on a forward-looking basis using the accounting policies applied by the issuer in its latest set of financial statements (i.e., revenue as presented in the primary financial statements adjusted only for assumptions about future economic conditions and courses of action), this forward-looking revenue is not a non-GAAP financial measure. Conversely, if an issuer discloses EBITDA on a forward-looking basis and does not disclose this financial measure in the financial statements, this forward-looking EBITDA does meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure that is forward-looking information.Issuers are reminded that forward-looking information is subject to the disclosure requirements in Parts 4A and 4B and section 5.8 of National Instrument 51-102 Continuous Disclosure Obligations (NI 51-102). Non-Financial Information For clarity, the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure does not include non-financial information such as the following: Number of units; Number of subscribers; Volumetric information; Number of employees or workforce by type of contract or geographical location; Environmental measures such as greenhouse gas emissions; Information on major shareholdings; Acquisition or disposal of the issuer's own shares; and Total number of voting rights. The above list is not exhaustive.We remind issuers that while non-financial information is not subject to the requirements of the Instrument, non-financial information is subject to various disclosure requirements under applicable securities legislation, including the requirement not to disclose misleading information."}
{"metadata":"11607###ngfm","text":"Definition of primary financial statements: The Instrument uses the terms statement of financial position, statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and statement of cash flows, to describe the primary financial statements. Issuers may use titles for the statements other than those terms if the titles comply with the financial reporting framework used in the preparation of the financial statements. For example, an issuer may use the title of balance sheet instead of statement of financial position."}
{"metadata":"11608###ngfm","text":"Definition of a supplementary financial measure: Component Information An issuer that operates in the retail industry may disclose financial results for same-store sales each reporting period. When same-store sales, a component of overall sales, is calculated in accordance with the accounting policies used to prepare the sales line item presented in the primary financial statements, it would not meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. However, since in this example same-store sales is used by the issuer to depict financial performance by reporting sales performance from period to period, it would meet the definition of a supplementary financial measure.Conversely, when the measure is not calculated in accordance with the issuer's accounting policies, such measure would meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. For example, if the sales figure in same-store sales is sales presented on a constant-dollar basis, this constant-dollar sales figure meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure since it excludes amounts (i.e., the effect of foreign exchange differences) that are included in the most directly comparable financial measure presented in the primary financial statements (i.e., sales). As a result, the constant dollar same-store sales measure in this example would meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure or the constant dollar same-store sales per square foot measure would meet the definition of a non-GAAP ratio.If an issuer discloses a financial measure that is a component of a financial statement line item to explain how the financial statement line item changed from period to period (in dollars or as a percentage, for instance), such a measure would not meet the definition of a supplementary financial measure if the measure is not intended to be disclosed on a periodic basis. For example, if an issuer experienced an unexpected increase in administrative expenses, it may analyze the reasons for changes in administrative expenses by, among other things, disclosing information about its insurance expense, a component of overall administrative expenses. In this example, insurance expense would not meet the definition of a supplementary financial measure because, among other things, the insurance expense was calculated in accordance with the accounting policies used to prepare the administrative expenses line item presented in the primary financial statements. Periodic Basis An element of the definition of a supplementary financial measure is that it is disclosed or is intended to be disclosed on a periodic basis. A measure will not be precluded from being considered a supplementary financial measure the first time it is disclosed if the measure is intended to be disclosed on an ongoing basis (e.g., in future quarterly and/or annual disclosures). Financial Ratios A financial ratio that is not a non-GAAP ratio would typically meet the definition of supplementary financial measure because such ratio is often disclosed on a periodic basis to depict historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flow.Financial ratios contain at least one financial component (either the numerator or the denominator).Examples include, but are not limited to the following ratios: Liquidity ratios such as the current ratio; Solvency ratios such as the debt-to-equity ratio; Profitability ratios such as the return on equity ratio or revenue per user; and Activity ratios such as the inventory turnover ratio.

{"metadata":"11626###ngfm","text":"Reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure: Clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(C) of the Instrument requires a quantitative reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable financial measure presented in the primary financial statements. For the purpose of clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(C) , a quantitative reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure is required to be the permitted format outlined in subsection 6(2) of the Instrument. An issuer may satisfy this requirement by providing a reconciliation in a clearly understandable way, such as a table. For purposes of presenting the reconciliation, an issuer may begin with the non-GAAP financial measure or the most directly comparable financial measure presented in the primary financial statements, provided the reconciliation is presented in an understandable and consistent manner. Most Directly Comparable Financial Measure The Instrument does not define the most directly comparable financial measure and therefore the issuer needs to apply judgment in determining the most directly comparable financial measure. In applying judgment, it is important for an issuer to consider the context of how the non-GAAP financial measure is used. For example, when the non-GAAP financial measure is discussed primarily as a performance measure used in determining cash generated by the issuer, or the issuer's distribution-paying capacity, its most directly comparable financial measure will be from the statement of cash flows. In practice, earnings-based measures and cash flow-based measures are used to disclose operational performance. If it is not clear from the way the non-GAAP financial measure is used what the most directly comparable financial measure is, consideration can be given to the nature, number and materiality of the reconciling items. Reconciling Items The reconciliation must be quantitative, separately itemizing and explaining each significant reconciling item. Source of Reconciling Items When a reconciling item is taken directly from the entity's financial statements, it should be named such that an investor is able to identify the item in those financial statements, and no further explanation of that reconciling item is required.When a reconciling item is not extracted directly from the entity's financial statements, but is, for example, a component of a line item in the entity's primary financial statements or originates from outside the primary financial statements, disclosure must be provided to satisfy clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(C) and subsection 6(2) of the Instrument. Such disclosure should identify the source of the reconciling item (e.g., the financial statement line item, the financial statement note, or the externally sourced document), if not obvious, and should explain how the amount is calculated, including a discussion of any significant judgments or estimates management has made in developing the reconciling items used in the reconciliation. Entity-Specific Inputs Reconciling items should be calculated using entity-specific inputs. An entity may make adjustments that are accepted within an industry; however, the quantum of these adjustments should be calculated using entity-specific information. For example, an entity may make an adjustment for operating capital expenditures, which is a standard adjustment in certain industries, but the amount of the adjustment should be calculated based on the entity's operating capital expenditures, and not by using only an 'industry average' amount as the sole factor. However, adjustments should be supportable and consistent with the usefulness explanation provided to address clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(B) of the Instrument. Level of Detail The level of detail expected in the reconciliation depends on the nature and complexity of the reconciling items. The adjustments made from the most directly comparable financial measure should be consistent with the explanation required by clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(B) of the Instrument regarding why the information is useful to investors and if applicable, how it is used by management. Explanations should be more detailed than merely stating what the reconciling item represents and should also cover the circumstances that give rise to the particular adjustment if it is not obvious.An other or adjusting items category to describe numerous insignificant reconciling items should not be used without further explanation as to the nature of items that comprise the category. Gross Basis Issuers should consider significant reconciling items on a gross basis. For example, an issuer is expected to separately itemize positive and negative adjustments unless netting is permitted under the financial reporting framework used in the preparation of the financial statements. Tax Reconciling items are commonly presented on a pre-tax basis to ensure that investors understand the gross amount of each reconciling item. If an issuer chooses to present reconciling items on a post-tax basis then the tax effect for each reconciling item should also be disclosed. Comparatives For comparative non-GAAP financial measures disclosed for a previous period under paragraph 6(1)(f) of the Instrument, a reconciliation to the corresponding most directly comparable financial measure is required for that previous period. Presentation in the Form of a Primary Financial Statement An issuer may present adjusted financial information outside the entity's financial statements using a format that is similar to one or more of the primary financial statements, but that is not in accordance with the financial reporting framework used to prepare the entity's financial statements. In this case, the adjusted financial information would contain non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, this would arise if an issuer presents such financial measures in a form that is similar to the following financial statements: A statement of financial position; A statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income; A statement of changes in equity; or A statement of cash flows. Presentation of this information as a single column that excludes the most directly comparable financial measures in a separate column would not satisfy clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(C) and subsection 6(2) of the Instrument. However, this information may be presented in the form of a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure if such presentation shows in separate columns each of the most directly comparable financial measures, the reconciling items, and the non-GAAP financial measures. An example of the separate column approach may be used when issuers with joint ventures present a full set of non-GAAP financial statements in the form of a columnar reconciliation that shows the issuer's statement of income as presented in the primary financial statements, an additional column with amounts related to equity accounted investees for each financial statement line item, and then a total column for each financial statement line item, which would be appropriately labelled as non-GAAP financial measures for each financial statement line item. This effectively creates the presentation of a full set of non-GAAP financial statements.When the adjusted presentation is used as a basis for the qualitative discussions and analysis of an entity's financial performance, financial position or cash flows with greater prominence than financial measures presented in the primary financial statements, this would not be considered to be in compliance with the prominence requirement in paragraph 6(1)(d) of the Instrument."}
{"metadata":"11627###ngfm","text":"Explanation of the reason for the change in a non-GAAP financial measure or a non-GAAP ratio: If the label or composition of the non-GAAP financial measure or non-GAAP ratio has changed from what was previously disclosed, the requirement of clauses 6(1)(e)(ii)(D) and 8(c)(iii)(C) of the Instrument would apply.Including additional reconciling items or excluding previously included reconciling items between the non-GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable financial measure constitutes a change in composition. A clear explanation of the reason for this change is required under clauses 6(1)(e)(ii)(D) and 8(c)(iii)(C) of the Instrument, which would include a restatement of comparatives, when disclosed as required under paragraph 6(1)(f) or 8(d) .A change in magnitude of an individual item would not constitute a change in composition. For example, an issuer may define adjusted earnings as earnings before impairment losses and transaction costs. Transaction costs may only be incurred every three years, such that there may be no adjustment in year two to reflect transaction costs, but there should be an explanation noting that the issuer expects that it will incur transaction costs in the future. In this example, the issuer should continue to include transaction costs in the explanation of the composition under clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(A) or 8(c)(iii)(A) to maintain consistency of the non-GAAP financial measure or non-GAAP ratio.Given that disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios is optional, disclosing a particular non-GAAP financial measure or non-GAAP ratio does not create an obligation to continue disclosing that measure in future periods. If, however, an issuer replaces a non-GAAP financial measure or a non-GAAP ratio with another measure or ratio, fraction or similar representation that achieves the same objectives (that is, the usefulness information provided to comply with clauses 6(1)(e)(ii)(B) and 8(c)(iii)(B) of the Instrument was consistent for both measures), the requirement of clauses 6(1)(e)(ii)(D) and 8(c)(iii)(C) of the Instrument would apply.If the label of a non-GAAP financial measure or non-GAAP ratio has changed, while the explanation for the change may be incorporated by reference, we expect the issuer to make it clear in the document that the label has changed in the current period from that disclosed in the prior period."}
{"metadata":"11628###ngfm","text":"Presenting comparative information for a non-GAAP financial measure or a non-GAAP ratio: Impracticable Understandably, it is impracticable for an issuer to provide the comparative disclosure required by paragraph 6(1)(f) or 8(d) of the Instrument when the current period is the first period of operations and no comparative period exists. However, when a comparative period exists, we do not consider the cost or the time involved in preparing the comparative information to be sufficient rationale for an issuer to assert that it is impracticable to disclose such information. Changes in Accounting Standards We would not consider adoption of a new accounting standard, which would include adoption of amendments to current accounting standards, or a change in accounting policy, to be a basis for not presenting comparative period disclosure, as the composition of the non-GAAP financial measure should continue to be the same.Adoption of new accounting standards, or changes in accounting policy, may modify measurement and recognition of transactions which will have an impact on line items, subtotals and totals over different financial periods. However, the composition of the non-GAAP financial measure itself should not change. Consider, for example, an issuer that discloses EBITDA as its non-GAAP financial measure, and in the current year adopts a new accounting standard which modifies the classification of certain expenditures from administrative expense to interest expense. While the resulting EBITDA measure will no longer include those transactions, EBITDA will continue to have the same composition, as it will comprise earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Therefore, the issuer would not be subject to the explanation of the reason for the change disclosure under clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(D) .The financial reporting framework used to prepare an entity's financial statements would determine whether comparative information is restated with adoption of a new accounting standard or change in accounting policy. For example, we expect comparative non-GAAP financial measures to be restated when a new accounting standard or policy is applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented. Conversely, if a new accounting standard is applied prospectively or retrospectively without restatement of a prior reporting period presented, the specified financial measures would also not be restated. In such circumstances, the issuer communicates that the comparative non-GAAP financial measures are disclosed under the previous financial reporting framework used to prepare the entity's financial statements.In both cases, the composition of the specified financial measure has not changed, and the explanation of the reason for the change disclosure under clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(D) would not be required."}

However, the principle that the non-GAAP ratios and capital management measures should be presented with no more prominence than that of measures from the primary financial statements remains the same.Many non-GAAP ratios and capital management measures do not have a most directly comparable financial measure. As such, issuers should consider the disclosure of the non-GAAP ratio and capital management measure in relation to the overall disclosure of similar financial measures presented in the primary financial statements to which the non-GAAP ratio or the capital management measure relates. For example, the prominence requirement in paragraph 8(b) of the Instrument is not met if the issuer focused its disclosure on an increased gross margin percentage without giving at least equally prominent disclosure to the fact that sales have significantly decreased over the same time period, resulting in a reduction in total profit period over period. In this example, it is assumed that the financial measure of gross margin is not presented in the primary financial statements and therefore meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. As a further example, the discussion of a total cash cost per ounce financial measure should not be more prominent than the discussion of cost of sales, the similar financial measure presented in the primary financial statements to which the non-GAAP ratio relates.An issuer that discloses a capital management measure such as adjusted debt will meet the requirement in paragraph 10(1)(a) by giving at least equally prominent disclosure to similar financial measures presented in the primary financial statements such as short-term and long-term debt.For a non-GAAP ratio or a capital management measure which has a most directly comparable financial measure presented in the primary financial statements, the guidance on prominence contained in this Policy for paragraph 6(1)(d) should be referred to.

A non-GAAP financial measure excludes amounts that are included in, or includes amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure specified, defined or determined under the issuer's GAAP.Some issuers disclose non-GAAP financial measures in press releases, management's discussion and analysis, prospectus filings, websites and marketing materials.Many non-GAAP financial measures are derived from profit or loss determined under an issuer's GAAP and, by omission of selected items, present a more positive picture of financial performance. Terms used to identify non-GAAP financial measures may include pro forma earnings, cash earnings, free cash flow, distributable cash, Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings, and earnings before non-recurring items. Many of these terms lack standard meanings and different issuers may use the same term to refer to different calculations.Staff is concerned that investors may be confused or even misled by non-GAAP financial measures. Staff is also concerned about the prominence of disclosure given to non-GAAP financial measures related to earnings compared to the prominence of earnings measures specified, defined or determined under an issuer's GAAP. In staff's view, these concerns can be addressed by appropriate disclosure accompanying non-GAAP financial measures.Some issuers disclose performance measures that are calculated without using financial measures (for example, number of units or number of subscribers). Some issuers disclose performance measures that are calculated using financial information presented in the financial statements (for example, sales per square foot, where the sales figure is extracted directly from the financial statements). In both of the preceding scenarios, such performance measures are not considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. However, if a non-GAAP financial measure is used to calculate a performance measure (such as an adjusted earnings financial measure used to calculate an adjusted earnings per unit measure), then that non-GAAP financial measure should be disclosed and Section III of this notice applies to that non-GAAP financial measure."}
{"metadata":"11678###ngfm","text":"Disclosure Accompanying Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Financial statements prepared in accordance with an issuer's GAAP provide investors with a clear basis for financial analysis and comparison among issuers. Staff recognizes that non-GAAP financial measures may provide investors with additional information to assist them in understanding critical components of an issuer's financial performance. However, an issuer should not present a non-GAAP financial measure in a way that confuses or obscures the most directly comparable measure specified, defined or determined under the issuer's GAAP presented in its financial statements.Staff reminds issuers of their responsibility to ensure that information they provide to the public is not misleading. Staff also reminds certifying officers of their obligations under National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings to make certifications regarding misrepresentations, fair presentation, and disclosure controls and procedures. A non-GAAP financial measure may be misleading if it includes positive components of the most directly comparable measure specified, defined or determined under the issuer's GAAP presented in its financial statements but omits similar negative components.In order to ensure that a non-GAAP financial measure does not mislead investors, an issuer should: state explicitly that the non-GAAP financial measure does not have any standardized meaning under the issuer's GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers; name the non-GAAP financial measure in a way that distinguishes it from disclosure items specified, defined or determined under an issuer's GAAP and in a way that is not misleading. For example, in presenting EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure, it would be misleading to exclude amounts for items other than interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; explain why the non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors and the additional purposes, if any, for which management uses the non-GAAP financial measure; present with equal or greater prominence to that of the non-GAAP financial measure, the most directly comparable measure specified, defined or determined under the issuer's GAAP presented in its financial statements; provide a clear quantitative reconciliation from the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable measure specified, defined or determined under the issuer's GAAP and presented in its financial statements, referencing to the reconciliation when the non-GAAP financial measure first appears in the document, or in the case of content on a website, in a manner that meets this objective (for example, by providing a link to the reconciliation); ensure that the non-GAAP financial measure does not describe adjustments as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, when a similar loss or gain is reasonably likely to occur within the next two years or occurred during the prior two years; and present the non-GAAP financial measure on a consistent basis from period to period; however, where an issuer changes the composition of the non-GAAP financial measure, explain the reason for the change and restate any comparative period presented.

{"metadata":"11679###ngfm","text":"Disclosing Additional Subtotals before Filing Financial Statements: An issuer's GAAP may require the presentation of additional subtotals in the financial statements when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the issuer's financial position or financial performance. An example of this requirement is found in paragraphs 55 and 85 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (IAS 1). An issuer may choose to present these additional subtotals in a press release or some other location outside of an issuer's financial statements before filing on SEDAR its financial statements. In order to avoid any confusion about these additional subtotals, management should explain their composition. This may be accomplished by: including a copy of the statement that contains these additional subtotals (for example, the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income), or reconciling these additional subtotals to the most directly comparable line item specified or defined by IFRS that will be presented in financial statements (for example, profit or loss).

The practices outlined in the paragraphs noted, will also help ensure that additional subtotals presented in the statement of cash flows do not mislead investors.In addition, if an issuer chooses to present additional subtotals from the statement of cash flows in a press release or some other location outside of an issuer's financial statements before filing on SEDAR its financial statements, then in order to avoid any confusion about these additional subtotals, management should explain their composition (as discussed in Section IV of this notice)."}
