{"metadata":"3860","text":"In this Instrument, a conflict of interest matter means (a) a situation where a reasonable person would consider a manager, or an entity related to the manager, to have an interest that may conflict with the manager's ability to act in good faith and in the best interests of the investment fund; or (b) a conflict of interest or self-dealing provision listed in Appendix A that restricts or prohibits an investment fund, a manager or an entity related to the manager from proceeding with a proposed action. Commentary 1. Section 5.1 of this Instrument requires that a manager refer all conflict of interest matters to the independent review committee (IRC). 2. The CSA do not consider the 'reasonable person' test described in paragraph (a) to capture inconsequential matters. It is expected that, among the factors the manager will look to for guidance to identify conflict of interest matters caught by this Instrument, will be industry best practices. The CSA expect, however, each manager to consider the nature of its investment fund operations when making its decisions about which conflict of interest matters it faces for the funds it manages. 3. The types of conflicts of interest faced by the portfolio manager or portfolio adviser (or sub-adviser) or any other entity related to the manager this Instrument captures relate to the decisions made on behalf of the investment fund that may affect or influence the manager's ability to make decisions in good faith and in the best interests of the investment fund. This Instrument is not intended to capture the conflicts of interest at the service provider level generally. The CSA expect the manager to consider whether a particular portfolio manager or portfolio adviser or any other 'entity related to the manager' would have any conflicts of interest falling within the definition. For example, paragraph (a) might, depending on the circumstances, capture these conflicts of the portfolio manager or portfolio adviser: portfolio management processes for the investment fund, including allocation of investments among a family of investment funds; and trading practices for the investment fund, including negotiating soft dollar arrangements with dealers with whom the adviser places portfolio transactions for the investment fund. 4. The CSA contemplate that an 'entity related to the manager' will have its own policies and procedures to address any conflicts of interest in its operations. It is expected the manager will make reasonable inquiries of these policies and procedures. The conflicts of interest facing these entities, including any third party portfolio manager or portfolio adviser, may affect, or be perceived to affect, the manager's ability to make decisions in the best interests of the investment fund. The manager is expected to refer such conflicts to the IRC under this Instrument. 5. For greater certainty, paragraph (b) requires that a 'conflict of interest matter' includes any course of action that the investment fund, the manager or an entity related to the manager would otherwise be restricted or prohibited from proceeding with because of a conflict of interest or self-dealing prohibition in securities legislation. These include the types of transactions described under subsection 5.2(1) of this Instrument. conflict of interest matter"}

Commentary 1. The CSA consider an 'entity related to the manager' in paragraph (a) to include: the portfolio manager or portfolio adviser (or sub-adviser) of the investment fund, including any third party portfolio manager or portfolio adviser; the administrator of a scholarship plan; and any person or company that can materially direct or affect the manager's management or policies, including through contractual agreements or ownership of voting securities. entity related to the manager"}
{"metadata":"3862","text":"(1) In this Instrument, a member of the independent review committee is independent if the member has no material relationship with the manager, the investment fund, or an entity related to the manager. (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a material relationship means a relationship which could reasonably be perceived to interfere with the member's judgment regarding a conflict of interest matter. Commentary 1. Under subsection 3.7(3), all members of the IRC must be independent of the manager, the investment fund and entities related to the manager. The CSA believe that all members must be independent because the principal function of the IRC is to review activities and transactions that involve inherent conflicts of interest between an investment fund and its manager. Given this role, it is important that the members of the IRC are free from conflicting loyalties. 2. While the members of the IRC should not themselves be subject to inherent conflicts or divided loyalties, the CSA recognize that there may be inherent conflicts relating to inter-fund issues where a single IRC acts for a family of investment funds. In those cases, this Instrument requires members to conduct themselves in accordance with their written charter and in accordance with the standard of care set out in this Instrument. The CSA do not consider the IRC's ability to set its own reasonable compensation to be a material relationship with the manager or investment fund under subsection 1.4(1). 3. A material relationship referred to in subsection 1.4(1) may include an ownership, commercial, charitable, industrial, banking, consulting, legal, accounting or familial relationship. The CSA expect managers and IRC members to consider both past and current relationships when determining whether a material relationship exists. For example, depending on the circumstances, the following individuals may be independent under section 1.4: an independent member of an existing advisory board or IRC of an investment fund; an independent member or former independent member of the board of directors, or of a special committee of the board of directors, of an investment fund; a former independent member of the board of directors, or special committee of the board of directors, of the manager; an individual appointed as a trustee for an investment fund; and an independent member of the board of directors, or of a special committee of the board of directors, of a registered trust company that acts as trustee for an investment fund. By way of further example, the CSA consider it unlikely that the following individuals would be independent under section 1.4: a person who is or has recently been an employee or executive officer of the manager or investment fund; and a person whose immediate family member is or has recently been an executive officer of the manager or investment fund. The CSA also consider that it would be rare that a member of the board of directors, or special committee of the board of directors, of a manager could be 'independent' within the meaning of this Instrument. One such example of when a member of the board of directors of a manager could be 'independent' may be owner-operated investment funds, sold exclusively to defined groups of investors, such as members of a trade or professional association or co-operative organization, who directly or indirectly, own the manager. In the case of these investment funds, the CSA view the interests of the independent members of the board of directors of the manager and investors as aligned. independent"}

{"metadata":"5169","text":"Securities lending describes the market practice whereby securities are temporarily transferred from one party (the lender) to another party (the borrower) in return for a fee. As part of the lending arrangement, the borrower is obliged to redeliver to the lender the securities or identical securities to those that were transferred or lent, either on demand or at the end of the loan term.Securities lending arrangements transfer title of securities from the lender to the borrower for the duration of the loan. During this period, the borrower has full ownership rights and may re-sell the securities as well as vote them. Securities lending arrangements between the lender and the borrower generally provide for payment to the lender of any economic benefits (for example, dividends) accruing to the securities while on loan. Therefore, securities lending separates the economic interest in the securities which remains with the lender from the ownership and voting rights which are transferred to the borrower. If the lender wants to vote the loaned securities it must, in accordance with the terms of the securities lending arrangement, either recall the securities or identical securities from the borrower or otherwise direct the voting of the loaned securities.Since securities lending arrangements involve a disposition and acquisition of securities, lenders and borrowers should consider securities lent (disposed) and borrowed (acquired) under securities lending arrangements in determining whether an early warning reporting obligation has been triggered.Paragraph 5.7(a) of the Instrument provides an exception for the lender of securities under a securities lending arrangement from the early warning requirements if the securities are transferred or lent pursuant to a securities lending arrangement that meets the criteria of a specified securities lending arrangement. If the securities lending arrangement is not a specified securities lending arrangement, then the early warning reporting requirements for dispositions of securities will apply to the disposition of securities by the lender under the securities lending arrangement.Paragraph 5.7(b) of the Instrument provides an exception for the borrower of securities under a securities lending arrangement from the early warning requirements if the securities or identical securities are borrowed, disposed of or acquired in connection with a borrower™s short sale if certain conditions are met. Short selling is a trading strategy where the borrower uses securities borrowed under a securities lending arrangement to settle a sale (disposition) of the securities to another party with the objective of later repurchasing (acquiring) identical securities at a lower price on the market to return the securities to the lender. If all the conditions of paragraph 5.7(b) are not satisfied, then the early warning reporting requirements will apply to the borrower in respect of securities borrowed under the securities lending arrangement and the disposition of and acquisition of the securities or identical securities in the market in connection with the securitieslending arrangement.

Issuers and insiders should review National Instrument 55-102 System for Electronic Disclosure by Insiders (SEDI) (NI 55-102) in order to determine their obligations for the filing of insider reports.(3) Although the Instrument sets out the principal insider reporting requirements and exemptions for issuers and insiders in Canada, a number of other CSA instruments also contain exemptions from the insider reporting requirements, including(a) National Instrument 51-102 Continuous Disclosure Obligations (NI 51- 102);(b) National Instrument 62-103 The Early Warning System and Related Take- Over Bid and Insider Reporting Issues (NI 62-103);(c) National Instrument 71-101 The Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (NI 71-101); and(d) National Instrument 71-102 Continuous Disclosure and Other Exemptions Relating to Foreign Issuers (NI 71-102).We have not included the insider reporting exemptions from these instruments in the Instrument because we think these exemptions are better situated within the context of these other instruments.

{"metadata":"5565","text":"(1) The insider reporting requirements serve a number of functions. These include deterring improper insider trading based on material undisclosed information and increasing market efficiency by providing investors with information concerning the trading activities of insiders of an issuer, and, by inference, the insiders™ views of their issuer™s prospects.(2) Insider reporting also helps prevent illegal or otherwise improper activities involving stock options and similar equity-based instruments, including stock option backdating, option repricing, and the opportunistic timing of option grants (spring-loading or bullet-dodging). This is because the requirement for timely disclosure of option grants and public scrutiny of such disclosure will generally limit opportunities for issuers and insiders to engage in improper dating practices.(3) Insiders should interpret the insider reporting requirements in the Instrument with these policy rationales in mind and comply with the requirements in a manner that gives priority to substance over form.

{"metadata":"5570","text":"General “ Subsection 1.1(1) of the Instrument contains the definition of reporting insider. The definition represents a principles-based approach to determining which insiders should file insider reports and enumerates a list of insiders whom we think generally satisfy both of the following criteria:(i) the insider in the ordinary course receives or has access to information as to material facts or material changes concerning the reporting issuer before the material facts or material changes are generally disclosed; and(ii) the insider directly or indirectly, exercises, or has the ability to exercise, significant power or influence over the business, operations, capital or development of the reporting issuer.In addition to enumerating a list of insiders, the definition also includes, in paragraph (i), a basket provision that explicitly states these two criteria. The basket provision articulates the fundamental principle that an insider who satisfies the criteria of routine access to material undisclosed information concerning a reporting issuer and significant influence over the reporting issuer should file insider reports.(2) Interpreting the basket criteria “ The CSA consider that insiders who come within the enumerated list of positions in the definition of reporting insider will generally satisfy the criteria of routine access to material undisclosed information and significant influence over the reporting issuer. We recognize that this may not always be the case for certain positions in the definition and have therefore included an exemption in section 9.3 of the Instrument for directors and officers of significant shareholders based on lack of routine access to material undisclosed information.If an insider does not fall within any of the enumerated positions, the insider should consider whether the insider has access to material undisclosed information and has influence over the reporting issuer that is reasonably commensurate with that of one or more of the enumerated positions. If the insider satisfies both of these criteria, the insider will fall within the basket provision of the reporting insider definition.(3) Meaning of significant power or influence “ In determining whether an insider satisfies the significant influence criterion, the insider should consider whether the insider exercises, or has the ability to exercise, significant influence over the business, operations, capital or development of the issuer that is reasonably comparable to that exercised by one or more of the enumerated positions in the definition.Certain positions or relationships with the issuer may give rise to reporting insider status in the case of certain issuers but not others, depending on the importance of the position or relationship to the business, operations, capital or development of the particular issuer. Similarly, the importance of a position or relationship to an issuer may change over time. For example, the directors and the CEO, CFO and COO of a 20 per cent subsidiary (i.e. not a major subsidiary, as defined in the Instrument) who are not reporting insiders for any other reason may be reporting insiders prior to and during a significant business acquisition or reorganization, or a market moving announcement.(4) Exercise of reasonable judgment “ The determination of whether an insider is a reporting insider based on the criteria in the basket provision will generally be a question of reasonable judgment. The CSA expect insiders to make reasonable determinations after careful consideration of all relevant facts but recognize that a reasonable determination may not always be a correct determination. The CSA recommend that insiders consult with their issuers when making this determination since confirming that the insider™s conclusion is consistent with the issuer™s view may help establish that a determination was reasonable. Insiders may also wish to seek professional advice or consider the reporting status of individuals in similar positions with the issuer or other similarly situated issuers.

{"metadata":"5571","text":"(1) General “ The term beneficial ownership is not defined in securities legislation. Accordingly, beneficial ownership must be determined in accordance with the ordinary principles of property and trust law of a local jurisdiction. In QuÃ©bec, due to the fact that the concept of beneficial ownership does not exist in civil law, the meaning of beneficial ownership has the meaning ascribed to it in section 1.4 of Regulation 14-501Q. The concept of beneficial ownership in QuÃ©becÂ legislation is often used in conjunction with the concept of control and direction, which allows for a similar interpretation of the concept of common law beneficial ownership in most jurisdictions.(2) Deemed beneficial ownership “ Although securities legislation does not define beneficial ownership, securities legislation in certain jurisdictions may deem a person to beneficially own securities in certain circumstances. For example, in some jurisdictions, a person is deemed to beneficially own securities that are beneficially owned by a company controlled by that person or by an affiliate of such company.(3) Post-conversion beneficial ownership “ Under the Instrument, a person has post-conversion beneficial ownership of a security, including an unissued security, if the person is the beneficial owner of a security convertible into the security within 60 days. For example, a person who owns special warrants convertible at any time and without payment of additional consideration into common shares will be considered to have post-conversion beneficial ownership of the underlying common shares. Under the Instrument, a person who has post- conversion beneficial ownership of securities may in certain circumstances be designated or determined to be an insider and may be a reporting insider. For example, if a person owns 9.9% of an issuer™s common shares and then acquires special warrants convertible into an additional 5% of the issuer™s common shares, the person will be designated or determined to be an insider under section 1.2 of the Instrument and will be a reporting insider under subsection 1.1(1) of the Instrument.The concept of post-conversion beneficial ownership of the underlying securities into which securities are convertible within 60 days is consistent with similar provisions for determining beneficial ownership of securities for the purposes of the early warning requirements in section 1.8 of National Instrument 62-104 Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids.(4) Beneficial ownership of securities held in a trust “ Under common law trust law, legal ownership is commonly distinguished from beneficial ownership. A trustee is generally considered to be the legal owner of the trust property; a beneficiary, the beneficial owner. Under the QuÃ©bec civil law, a trust is governed by the QuÃ©bec Civil Code.A reporting insider who has a beneficial interest in securities held in a trust may have"}
{"metadata":"5571","text":"or share beneficial ownership of the securities for insider reporting purposes, depending on the particular facts of the arrangement and upon the governing law of the trust, whether common law or civil law. We will generally consider a person to have or share beneficial ownership of securities held in a trust if the person has or shares(a) a beneficial interest in the securities held in the trust and has or shares voting or investment power over the securities held in the trust; or(b) legal ownership of the securities held in the trust and has or shares voting or investment power over the securities held in the trust.(5) Disclaimers of beneficial ownership “ The CSA generally will not regard a purported disclaimer of a beneficial interest in, or beneficial ownership of, securities as being effective for the purposes of determining beneficial ownership under securities legislation unless such disclaimer is irrevocable and has been generally disclosed to the public.(6) When ownership passes “ Securities legislation of certain local jurisdictions provides that ownership is deemed to pass at the time an offer to sell is accepted by the purchaser or the purchaser™s agent or an offer to buy is accepted by the vendor or the vendor™s agent. The CSA is of the view that, for the purposes of the insider reporting requirement beneficial ownership passes at the same time.3.3 Meaning of control or direction(1) The term control or direction is not defined in Canadian securities legislation except in QuÃ©bec, where the Securities Act (QuÃ©bec), in sections 90, 91 and 92, defines the concept of control and deems situations where a person has control over securities. For purposes of the Instrument, a person will generally have control or direction over securities if the person, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship or otherwise has or shares(a) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of, such securities and/or(b) investment power, which includes the power to acquire or dispose, or to direct the acquisition or disposition of such securities.(2) A reporting insider may have or share control or direction over securities through a power of attorney, a grant of limited trading authority, or a management agreement. This would also include a situation where a reporting insider acts as a trustee for an estate (or in QuÃ©bec as a liquidator) or other trust in which securities of the reporting insider™s issuer are included within the assets of the trust. This may also be the case if a spouse (or any other person related to the reporting insider) owns the securities or acts as trustee, but the reporting insider has or shares control or direction over the securities held in trust. In addition, this may be the case where the reporting insider is an officer or director of another issuer that owns securities of the reporting insider™s issuer and the reporting insider is able to influence the investment or voting decisions of the issuer.

{"metadata":"5572","text":"(1) Part 4 of the Instrument contains the supplemental insider reporting requirement. The supplemental insider reporting requirement is consistent with the predecessor insider reporting requirement for derivatives that previously existed in some jurisdictions under former MI 55-103. However, because Part 3 of the Instrument requires insiders, as part of the primary insider reporting requirement, to file insider reports about transactions involving related financial instruments, most transactions that were previously subject to a reporting requirement under former MI 55-103 will be subject to the primary insider reporting requirement under Part 3 of the Instrument.(2) If a reporting insider enters into an equity monetization transaction or other derivative-based transaction that falls outside of the primary insider reporting requirement in Part 3 of the Instrument, the reporting insider must report the transaction under Part 4. For example, certain types of monetization transactions may be found to alter an insider™s economic exposure to the insider™s issuer but not alter the insider™s economic interest in a security. If a reporting insider enters into, materially amends or terminates this type of transaction, the insider must report the transaction under Part 4. Supplemental insider reporting requirement"}
{"metadata":"5573","text":"(1) What are equity monetization transactions? There are a variety of sophisticated derivative-based strategies that permit investors to dispose of, in economic terms, an equity position in a public company without attracting certain tax and non-tax consequences associated with a conventional disposition of such position. These strategies, which are sometimes referred to as equity monetization strategies, allow an investor to receive a cash amount similar to proceeds of disposition, and transfer part or all of the economic risk and/or return associated with securities of an issuer, without actually transferring ownership of or control over such securities. (The term monetization generally refers to the conversion of an asset (such as securities) into cash.)(2) What are the concerns with equity monetization transactions? Where a reporting insider enters into a monetization transaction, and does not disclose the existence or material terms of that transaction, there is potential for harm to investors and the integrity of the insider reporting regime because¢ an insider in possession of material undisclosed information, although prohibited from trading in securities of the issuer, may be able to profit improperly from such information by entering into derivative-based transactions that mimic trades in securities of the reporting issuer;¢ market efficiency will be impaired since the market is deprived of important information relating to the market activities of the insider; and¢ since the insider™s publicly reported holdings no longer reflect the insider™s true economic position in the issuer, the public reporting of such holdings (e.g., in an insider report or a proxy circular) may in fact materially mislead investors.If a reporting insider enters into a transaction which satisfies one or more of the policy rationales for insider reporting, but for technical reasons it may be argued that the transaction falls outside of the primary insider reporting requirement in Part 3 of the Instrument, the insider will be required to file an insider report under Part 4 unless an exemption is available. In this way, the market can make its own determination as to the significance, if any, of the transaction in question. Insider reporting of equity monetization transactions"}
{"metadata":"5574","text":"(1) Section 5.1 of the Instrument contains an interpretation provision that applies to Part 5. Because of this provision, directors and officers of a reporting issuer and of a major subsidiary of a reporting issuer can use the exemption in this Part for both acquisitions and specified dispositions of securities and related financial instruments under an automatic securities purchase plan (ASPP).(2) The exemption does not apply to securities acquired under a cash payment option of a dividend or interest reinvestment plan or a lump-sum provision of a share purchase plan.(3) The exemption does not apply to an automatic securities disposition plan (sometimes referred to as a pre-arranged structured sales plan) (an ASDP) established between a reporting insider and a broker, since an ASDP is designed to facilitate dispositions not acquisitions. However, if a reporting insider can demonstrate that an ASDP is genuinely an automatic plan and that the insider cannot make discrete investment decisions through the plan, we may consider granting exemptive relief on an application basis to permit the insider to file reports on an annual basis.(4) The exemption is not available for a grant of options or similar securities to reporting insiders, since, in many cases, the reporting insider will be able to make an investment decision in respect of the grant. If an insider is an executive officer or a director of the reporting issuer or a major subsidiary, the insider may be participating in the decision to grant the options or other securities. Even if the insider does not participate in the decision, we think information about options or similar securities granted to this group of insiders is important to the market and the insider should disclose this information in a timely manner. Automatic Securities Purchase Plans"}
{"metadata":"5575","text":"(1) Paragraph 5.1(3)(a) of the Instrument provides that a disposition or transfer of securities is a specified disposition if, among other things, it does not involve a discrete investment decision by the director or officer. The term discrete investment decision generally refers to the exercise of discretion involved in a specific decision to purchase, hold or sell a security. The purchase of a security as a result of the application of a pre-determined, mechanical formula does not generally represent a discrete investment decision (other than the initial decision to enter into the plan). For example, for an individual who holds stock options in a reporting issuer, the decision to exercise the stock options will generally represent a discrete investment decision. If the individual is a reporting insider, we think the individual should report this information in a timely fashion, since this decision may convey information that other market participants may consider relevant to their own investing decisions.(2) The definition of specified disposition of securities contemplates, among other things, a disposition made to satisfy a tax withholding obligation arising from the acquisition of securities under an ASPP in certain circumstances. Under some types of ASPPs, an issuer or plan administrator may sell, on behalf of a plan participant, a portion of the securities that would otherwise be distributed to the plan participant in order to satisfy a tax withholding obligation. In such plans, the participant typically may elect either to provide the issuer or the plan administrator with a cheque to cover this liability or to direct the issuer or plan administrator to sell a sufficient number of the securities that would otherwise be distributed to cover this liability. In many cases, for reasons of convenience, a plan participant will simply direct the issuer or the plan administrator to sell a portion of the securities.Although we think that the election as to how a tax withholding obligation will be funded contains an element of a discrete investment decision, we are satisfied that, where the election occurs sufficiently in advance of the actual disposition of securities, it is acceptable for a report of a disposition made to satisfy a tax withholding obligation to be made on an annual basis. Accordingly, a disposition made to satisfy a tax withholding obligation will be a specified disposition of securities if it meets the criteria contained in paragraph 5.1(3)(b) of the Instrument. Specified Dispositions of Securities"}
{"metadata":"5576","text":"If securities acquired under an ASPP are disposed of or transferred, other than through a specified disposition of securities, and the insider has not previously disclosed the acquisition of these securities, the insider report should disclose, for each acquisition of securities which the insider is now disposing of or transferring, information about the date of acquisition of the securities, the number of securities acquired and the acquisition price of such securities. The report should also disclose, for each disposition or transfer, information about each disposition or transfer of securities. Alternative Reporting Requirements"}
{"metadata":"5577","text":"The rationale underlying the alternative reporting requirement is the need for reporting insiders to periodically update their publicly disclosed holdings to ensure that their publicly disclosed holdings convey an accurate picture of their holdings. If an individual has ceased to be subject to the insider reporting requirements at the time the alternative report becomes due, the market generally would not benefit from the information in the alternative report. Accordingly, we provided an exemption in subsection 5.4(3) of the Instrument in these circumstances. Exemption from the Alternative Reporting Requirement"}
{"metadata":"5578","text":"(1) Part 5 of the Instrument provides a limited exemption from the insider reporting requirement only in circumstances in which an insider, by virtue of participation in an ASPP, is not making discrete investment decisions for acquisitions under such plan. Accordingly, if it is intended that insiders of an issuer rely on this exemption for a particular plan of an issuer, the issuer should design and administer the plan in a manner that is consistent with this limitation.(2) To fit within the definition of an ASPP, the plan must set out a written formula or criteria for establishing the timing of the acquisitions, the number of securities that the insider can acquire and the price payable. If a plan participant is able to exercise discretion in relation to these matters either in the capacity of a recipient of the securities or through participating in the decision-making process of the issuer making the grant, he or she may be able to make a discrete investment decision in respect of the grant or acquisition. We think a reporting insider in these circumstances should disclose information about the grant within the normal timeframe and not on a deferred basis. Design and Administration of Plans"}

Overview"}
{"metadata":"5580","text":"(1) The issuer grant report exemption reduces the regulatory burden on insiders that is associated with insider reporting of stock options and similar instruments since it allows an issuer to make a single filing on SEDI. This filing provides the market with timely information about the existence and material terms of the grant, making it unnecessary for each of the affected reporting insiders to file an insider report about the grant within the ordinary time periods.(2) The concept of an issuer grant report is generally similar to the concept of an issuer event report in that the decision to make the grant originates with the issuer. Accordingly, at the time of the grant, the issuer will generally be in a better position than the reporting insiders who are the recipients of the grant to communicate information about the grant to the market in a timely manner.(3) There is no obligation for an issuer to file an issuer grant report for a grant of stock options or similar instruments. An issuer may choose to do so to assist its reporting insiders with their reporting obligations and to communicate material information about its compensation practices to the market in a timely manner.(4) If an issuer chooses not to file an issuer grant report, the issuer should take all reasonable steps to notify reporting insiders of their grants in a timely manner to allow reporting insiders to comply with their reporting obligations.(5) The concept of an issuer grant report is different from the issuer event report that an issuer is required to make under Part 2 of NI 55-102 in that an issuer is not required to file an issuer grant report.

{"metadata":"5581","text":"Under securities legislation, a reporting issuer may become an insider of itself in certain circumstances and therefore subject to an insider reporting requirement in relation to transactions involving its own securities. Under the definition of insider in securities legislation, a reporting issuer becomes an insider of itself if it has purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired a security of its own issue, for so long as it continues to hold that security. In certain jurisdictions, a reporting issuer may also become an insider of itself if it acquires and holds securities of its own issue through an affiliate, because in certain jurisdictions a person is deemed to beneficially own securities beneficially owned by affiliates. Where a reporting issuer is an insider of itself, the reporting issuer will also be a reporting insider under the Instrument. Introduction"}

Similarly, a decision at the parent issuer level that the parent issuer will seek to sell its holding in the subsidiary investment issuer would also generally represent a material fact or material change concerning the investment issuer.

While certain information filed in SEDI is personal information within the meaning of the Federal Privacy Act, the Act provides an exemption from the consent requirement in respect of personal information that is, by law, collected and placed in a public registry if the collection, use and disclosure relates directly to the purposes for which the personal information appears in the public registry. This exemption is based on the recognition that often there are legitimate primary purposes for which the personal information is collected, used or disclosed and, therefore, as long as the information is collected, used or disclosed for the primary purposes, no consent is required.In Quebec, the Act Respecting Access to Documents Held by Public Bodies and the Protection of Personal Information, R.S.Q. c. A-2.1 (the Public Sector Act) and the Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector, R.S.Q. c. P-39.1 (the Private Sector Act) are both applicable to information filed in SEDI. Under the Public Sector Act, personal information which, by law, is public is not considered to be nominative (or personal) and, therefore, is not confidential. The Private Sector Act, which applies to persons engaged in carrying on an enterprise (excluding a public body within the meaning of the Public Sector Act and any person that holds information on behalf of the public body), requires an individual's consent to the use or disclosure of personal information concerning the individual in most circumstances. Further, this consent must be manifest, free and enlightened, and must be given for specific purposes. However, Bill 122, which will amend the Private Sector Act and which was introduced in the Quebec legislature on May 11, 2000, will harmonize the Private Sector Act with the Public Sector Act. Bill 122 provides that personal information which, by law, is public is not confidential. Consequently, if the Quebec legislature adopts Bill 122, the use and communication of publicly available information filed in SEDI will not be subject to the consent requirement in the Private Sector Act.*This title was provided by Lexata; it is not part of the companion policy.

{"metadata":"13807","text":"The purpose of this notice is to set out practices recommended by staff (Staff or we) of the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) for issuers and insiders in relation to the establishment, administration and disclosure of Automatic Securities Disposition Plans (ASDPs or plans). Typically, an ASDP is an arrangement between an insider and a dealer or a plan administrator that involves the sale of securities of an issuer over a predetermined period and in accordance with a predetermined set of instructions.Important concerns with respect to ASDPs have recently been raised, both in terms of good corporate governance and public confidence in the fairness of our capital markets. Insiders generally control the timing of the adoption of ASDPs, which can raise questions about whether the plans are made in good faith and whether insiders are in possession of material non-public information (MNPI) at the time the plans are adopted. Insiders may also generally amend, suspend or terminate plans, which could make it possible to misuse plans.Staff is providing guidance relating to ASDPs to reduce the potential for improper insider trades under these plans. This guidance can also assist issuers and insiders in managing market perception of insider trades under ASDPs.This notice does not modify any existing legal requirements or create new ones. Staff notes that there is an insider trading defense or exemption available under securities legislation, where the trade in securities is made under an automatic plan entered into prior to the insider acquiring knowledge of MNPI (Legal Defense). Some of the recommended practices outlined in this guidance may be relevant for insiders when considering whether they can rely on the Legal Defense. In addition, in the view of Staff, the processes outlined in this guidance are consistent with the principles of good corporate governance and transparency in connection with the establishment and use of ASDPs and the reporting of trades under the plans.*This title is provided by Lexata; it is not part of the notice. Purpose of Automatic Plans Notice*"}
{"metadata":"13808","text":"Under securities legislation, insiders are generally prohibited from trading in an issuer's securities with knowledge of MNPI. However, insiders may rely on the Legal Defense when their trades are made under an automatic plan referred to in securities legislation. Insiders that are reporting insiders as defined in National Instrument 55-104 Insider Reporting Requirements and Exemptions (NI 55-104) are required to file an insider report each time there is a trade in securities of the issuer by or on behalf of the insider under an ASDP in accordance with NI 55-104.We note that executive officers and directors are increasingly being encouraged to build and hold a significant level of securities ownership in the issuers that they manage or oversee in order to align their interests with other security holders. While the issuer's securities may form an important part of compensation, the insider trading prohibition under securities legislation and regular exposure to MNPI may limit the ability of insiders to sell the securities they receive as part of their compensation arrangements and often results in insiders being unable to trade securities for extended periods of time.We recognize that a well-designed and well-administered ASDP can be a legitimate mechanism for trading by insiders. However, it is important to ensure that ASDPs contain meaningful conditions and restrictions to ensure that insiders are not able to benefit from MNPI with respect to the issuer and that ASDPs are automatic in substance.*This title is provided by Lexata; it is not part of the notice. Insider Trading and Automatic Plans*"}
{"metadata":"13809","text":"We encourage issuers and insiders to consider the following guidance when establishing and using ASDPs and reporting trades under the plans. Following the recommendations presented in this notice is not a substitute for a legal determination regarding the availability of the Legal Defense to protect insiders from insider trading liability. As such, insiders should perform their own analysis to determine whether the Legal Defense has been satisfied.*This title is provided by Lexata; it is not part of the notice. Guidance is not Legally Determinative*"}
{"metadata":"13810","text":"Entering into the plan by insider To address concerns that a plan may be contrary to the public interest, ASDPs should be entered into by an insider in good faith, and not for the purpose of evading the insider trading prohibition. In addition, the Legal Defense will not be available if the plan is entered into when the insider is in possession of MNPI with respect to the issuer.We note that many issuers have adopted an insider trading policy that imposes trading blackouts at certain times [FN 1]. This is intended to prevent trading at times when there is a heightened risk that insiders have MNPI. Trading blackouts are also intended to prevent the appearance of questionable trading, and to protect the reputation of the issuer. Insiders should review and comply with the issuer's insider trading policy, including any stipulations on when plans may be entered into. In the absence of such stipulations, we recommend that issuers consider amending their insider trading policies to include a specific restriction against entering into ASDPs during trading blackouts.Oversight by issuer We recommend that the issuer oversee the establishment and use of ASDPs by its insiders to ensure that the plans and the insiders comply with securities legislation and any insider trading policy or other relevant internal policies that the issuer may have adopted [FN 2].Oversight of ASDPs by an issuer contributes to their legitimacy and the issuer and its insiders would, in Staff's view, benefit from the involvement of the issuer. This involvement could reduce reputational exposure for the issuer and litigation risks potentially linked to the improper use of ASDPs by the insider. If the ASDP is not established by the issuer, then we encourage insiders to notify the issuer of their intent to enter into an ASDP in order to enable the issuer to provide guidance and oversight of the ASDP to the insider.As part of its oversight and to minimize its risks, we recommend that the issuer review the terms and conditions of ASDPs to assess whether they are automatic in substance and contain protections against inappropriate trading activities by insiders. In addition, we recommend that the insider request that the issuer certify to the dealer that, to the best of the issuer's knowledge, the insider is not in possession of MNPI when entering into the ASDP and that the ASDP is entered into in accordance with any insider trading policy or other relevant internal policies of the issuer.As part of its risk mitigation, we recommend that the issuer take reasonable steps to periodically confirm that the insider continues to comply with the terms and conditions of the ASDP and any insider trading policy or other relevant internal policies adopted by the issuer.We also particularly recommend that the issuer monitor the use of the ASDP upon the occurrence of significant events in the life of the issuer before those significant events are publicly disclosed. Examples of significant events include transactions such as a merger, an acquisition or a divestiture, or a material change affecting an issuer's business, operations or capital. Staff is of the view that monitoring the use of the plan when a significant event occurs in this manner would also assist the issuer in considering whether any amendment, suspension or termination of the plan is appropriate during a period in which the insider may be in possession of MNPI.FN 1 We note that section 6.10 of National Policy 51-201 Disclosure Standards contains guidance as to insider trading policies and trading blackout periods.FN 2 In Quebec, contrary to what is provided under securities legislation in other provinces and territories, an automatic plan must be established by an issuer in order to be used for the purposes of the Legal Defense. Establishment of The Plan"}
{"metadata":"13811","text":"Trading parameters and other instructions We recommend that the insider provide clear trading parameters and other instructions in writing to the dealer or plan administrator at the time of entering into the ASDP. The plan should either include a formula or specify the number of securities to be sold, and set out any minimum trade price and any date or frequency of sales. Providing pre-determined trading parameters or other instructions when entering into the plan would reduce the risk of the insider attempting to make discrete investment decisions, such as influencing the timing of trades or the number of securities to be sold.We also recommend that the plan prohibit the dealer from consulting with the insider regarding any sales under the plan and prohibit the insider from disclosing to the dealer any information concerning the issuer that might influence the execution of the plan.Minimum term While the term of an ASDP is generally set to meet the needs of the insider, we recommend that the term be sufficiently long to avoid any potential use of MNPI (for example, 12 months). Although we recognize that it may be the result of legitimate trading parameters and other instructions, we recommend avoiding concentrating trades at the beginning of the term of a plan to help insiders manage the perception in the market that trades were timed to benefit from MNPI or that information was withheld to the market to benefit insiders.Waiting periodWe recommend that trades under an ASDP do not start before the issuer's next interim financial report or annual financial statements, as the case may be, have been filed.We are of the view that the waiting period, which is the period between the establishment of an ASDP and the first transaction made under the plan, is key to the legitimacy of ASDPs. The longer the waiting period, the more likely any insider's MNPI will be obsolete or publicly disclosed prior to the commencement of trading under the plan.Amendments, suspension and termination We recommend that an ASDP contain meaningful restrictions on the ability of the insider to amend, suspend or terminate the plan that have the effect of ensuring that the insider cannot benefit from MNPI.Amendments to the terms and conditions of an ASDP, such as its trading parameters and other instructions, as well as the suspension or termination of an ASDP by an insider, may give rise to a perception that the change to the plan is motivated by MNPI possessed by the insider and could call into question the automatic nature of the plan. However, we recognize that a plan may need to be amended, suspended or terminated for legitimate reasons in certain circumstances. In addition, we recognize that the ASDP may provide for pre-established automatic suspension or termination events (such as the death of the insider, the bankruptcy of the issuer, the entering into takeover bids, arrangements, mergers, acquisitions or other transactions affecting the securities of the issuer). We therefore recommend imposing the following meaningful restrictions on an insider's ability to amend, suspend or terminate an ASDP, among other restrictions which may be considered appropriate: imposing a limit on the number or nature of permitted amendments; prohibiting any amendment, suspension or termination during trading blackouts under the issuer's insider trading policy; requiring that the insider represent to the dealer or plan administrator that the insider is not in possession of MNPI at the time of the amendment, suspension or termination; requiring the insider to request that the issuer certify to the dealer or plan administrator that, to the best of the issuer's knowledge, the insider is not in possession of MNPI when amending, suspending or terminating the ASDP; requiring the insider to request that the issuer certify to the dealer or plan administrator that the ASDP is amended, suspended or terminated in accordance with any insider trading policy or other relevant internal policies of the issuer; imposing the waiting period recommended above after any amendment or suspension; requiring that the issuer or the insider disclose in a news release filed on SEDAR [FN 3] the circumstances that led to the amendment, suspension or termination and, where applicable, the nature of the amendment, together with a representation by the insider that the insider was not in possession of any MNPI at the time of such amendment, suspension or termination; obtaining the approval of the board of directors of the issuer for any amendment, suspension or termination.To help manage perception in the market, we also recommend that an insider consider whether changing the number of the issuer's securities sold under the plan through discrete investment decisions to sell the securities outside the ASDP, or establishing overlapping plans, could be considered an indirect amendment to the plan.FN 3 References to SEDAR in this notice mean the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval as at the date of this notice, and also include any successor to that system. Administration of The Plan"}
{"metadata":"13812","text":"Disclosure regarding the ASDPIn order to enhance transparency of trading by insiders in the market, we recommend that the issuer or the insider disclose relevant information regarding the ASDP by way of a news release filed on SEDAR.Specifically, we recommend that the issuer or the insider publicly disclose the establishment of the plan and the plan's principal terms and conditions, such as the parties to the plan, its term, the waiting period before the trades can start under the plan and the restrictions on the ability of the insider to amend, suspend or terminate the plan. Such disclosure would also benefit issuers as it would help them manage market perception of the sale of securities by insiders.In addition, we recommend that the news release indicate the number of securities to be sold under the ASDP and the minimum price at which these securities can be sold, if such a minimum price is specified in the trading parameters provided in the ASDP. This disclosure could provide valuable information for the market as to the insider's views of the issuer's prospects.As already discussed in this notice, we also recommend that the market be made aware by way of a news release of any special circumstances occurring in connection with the plan, such as its amendment, suspension or termination. Disclosure in insider reports When filing insider reports, we recommend that an insider specify in the comment section that the trades were made under an ASDP.This disclosure would enable the market to understand that the information provided under each subsequent report does not reflect discrete investment decisions made by the insider but is instead related to a previously announced ASDP. We also remind insiders that the transfer of an insider's securities to the dealer or plan administrator for the purpose of an ASDP is a transfer that should be reported in accordance with section 3.3 of NI 55-104, which requires an insider to file a report disclosing all transfers of control over the securities they hold in the issuer.*This title is provided by Lexata; it is not part of the notice.

The subsequent examples generally refer the reader back to the step-by-step approach taken in the first example, highlighting necessary changes.The examples discussed in this notice have necessarily been simplified and are for illustrative purposes only. The examples assume the following set of facts:ABC Inc. is a reporting issuer. John is a director of ABC Inc. and is therefore a reporting insider (as defined in NI 55-104) of ABC Inc. On March 1, 2010, John acquired 10 shares of ABC Inc. at a fair market value (FMV) price of $10 per share. On March 1, 2011, shares of ABC Inc. have a FMV of $100 per share. John does not wish to sell the shares, but is concerned that the shares might fall in value, and wishes to protect at least $80 of the gain (that is, to lock in the share price at at least $90).The examples also assume that the following necessary preliminary steps have been taken: ABC Inc. has completed an issuer profile supplement; John has a valid SEDI user ID and password; John has created his insider profile in SEDI and has his insider access key; and John has previously added ABC Inc. to his insider profile.For additional information about filing an insider report under SEDI, please refer to 55-102CP, SN 55-316 and the SEDI online help available on the SEDI website (www.sedi.ca).

This contract may be settled at an earlier date, subject to an adjustment to the settlement price. InvestBank hedges its risk under the forward contract through a hedging strategy involving short sales into the secondary market.Insider Reporting Requirement: John is required to file an insider report within five (calendar) days of March 1, 2011. (See Part 3 of NI 55-104.) For an example of how this transaction would be reported, see below. Unless InvestBank is also a reporting insider of ABC Inc., InvestBank is not required to file an insider report.

Note: In SEDI, third-party derivative arrangements are considered to be securities. Such arrangements may or may not be considered securities under securities law generally, depending upon the facts and circumstances of the arrangement in question. To the extent derivative instruments do not, as a matter of law, constitute securities, they will generally be related financial instruments. See commentary in subsection 1.4(6) of 55-104CP.

This report will normally be publicly available on SEDI within five minutes of filing.Note: Generally, where a reporting insider files an insider report in respect of a third-party derivative such as a forward contract, the reporting insider will be required to file a second report at the time the derivative is settled, matures or otherwise closed out. For example, John in this example will be required to file an insider report within five days of March 1, 2016 (assuming that the contract settles on that date and that John is still a reporting insider on that date). The report will show i) a disposition of the forward contract, and ii) a disposition of the underlying common shares. FN 2 In this example, $90 is assumed to represent the present value of $109.50 on March 1, 2016. Assuming an annual compounding of 4%, John and InvestBank are in the same position (absent any consideration of taxes) whether they proceed by way of a sale today at $90 or a sale five years from today at $109.50. In the case of a sale today, John receives $90, which he may then invest at 4%. Assuming an annual compounding return of 4%, at the end of five years, John will have received cash in the amount of $109.50. In the case of the forward sale at the end of five years, John will have received cash in the amount of $109.50. Example 1"}

The loan bears interest at 6 per cent per annum. The loan has a term of approximately five years, and matures on March 1, 2016. As security for the loan, John pledges the 10 ABC Inc. shares. Recourse under the loan is limited to the pledged securities (or identical collateral substituted therefor). (In other words, John may settle his obligations under the loan on a cash settlement basis or by physical delivery of 10 ABC Inc. shares.) InvestBank hedges its risk under the contract through a hedging strategy involving short sales into the secondary market.Insider Reporting Requirement: John is required to file an insider report within five (calendar) days of March 1, 2011. (See Part 3 of NI 55-104.) For an example of how to report this transaction, see below. Unless InvestBank is also a reporting insider of ABC Inc., InvestBank is not required to file an insider report.Instructions for Example 4 In the above example, the term of the loan agreement limiting recourse to the collateral (or to identical collateral delivered in substitution for the original collateral) effectively operates as a put option. John can repay the principal amount of $900 at the term of the loan. Alternatively, John can satisfy his obligation under the loan agreement to repay the principal amount of $900 by releasing his interest in the collateral (or by delivering another 10 ABC Inc. shares in substitution for the pledged shares), regardless of their value at the term of the loan.John can report this transaction in a number of ways. One approach would be to report this transaction as an acquisition of an OTC Put Option.

Effectively, John has an option to put 10 shares to InvestBank at a notional price of $900 (or $90 per share). Since the put option exercise price is $900, John would enter 900 in the field Conversion or exercise price.27.

On April 30, 2010, the Canadian Securities Administrators introduced a new insider reporting regime established by NI 55-104. Under NI 55-104, the insider reporting requirement is generally limited to reporting insiders (as defined in NI 55-104) and certain persons who may be designated insiders for certain historical transactions (see s. 3.5 of NI 55-104).

{"metadata":"13902","text":"Background 1. ABC Inc. (the Issuer) is a reporting issuer in all provinces and territories.2. On January 1, 2009, I became the CEO of the Issuer. I am therefore an insider of the Issuer under Canadian securities legislation. I have filed all required insider reports since becoming CEO.3. On April 30, 2010, NI 55-104 came into force.4. NI 55-104 contains a new definition of reporting insider. The definition of reporting insider includes a CEO of a reporting issuer. I am therefore a reporting insider for this Issuer under NI 55-104.5. Section 3.2 of NI 55-104 states that a reporting insider must file an insider report in respect of a reporting issuer, within 10 days of becoming a reporting insider, disclosing certain prescribed information.Question 1. Do I have to file a new initial report under section 3.2 within 10 days of April 30, 2010? (In other words, have I become a reporting insider as a result of NI 55-104 coming into force?) I do not otherwise have any transactions involving securities or related financial instruments to report.Response 1. No, you do not have to file a new initial report. The term reporting insider is simply intended to refer to a defined class of insiders who have reporting obligations. A person is determined to be an insider by operation of the statutory definition of insider. A person is a reporting insider for the purposes of the insider reporting requirements in NI 55-104 if the person has a position or function, such as CEO or director, or has a particular type of relationship to a reporting issuer, described in the definition of reporting insider. We do not consider you to have become a reporting insider simply through the introduction of this term in NI 55-104.

On April 30, 2010, NI 55-104 came into force. The definition of major subsidiary in NI 55-104 has been amended from the definition in NI 55-101 in that the assets and revenue thresholds have been increased from 20% to 30%.4. SubCo is not a major subsidiary of the Issuer as defined in NI 55-104. I am not an insider of the Issuer in any capacity other than as CEO of SubCo. I am therefore not a reporting insider for this Issuer under NI 55-104.Question1. Do I need to amend my SEDI profile, or otherwise do anything, to disclose the fact that I am not a reporting insider under NI 55-104?Response1. No. There is no requirement to file an amended insider profile on SEDI for an insider who has ceased to have reporting obligations because the insider is not a reporting insider under NI 55-104.2. However, we recommend that an insider who has previously filed insider reports, but as of April 30, 2010 is no longer required to file insider reports because they are not a reporting insider under NI 55-104, add a comment on SEDI in the Remarks field regarding their change of status. This can be done on either their next transaction to be filed on SEDI or by amending their last transaction already filed on SEDI. A member of the public viewing the insider reports on SEDI will then know why the insider ceased reporting.Note: section 4.3.1.19 of CSA Staff Notice 55-310 included similar guidance for insiders who previously filed insider reports and then proposed to rely on an exemption from insider reporting in Part 2 or Part 3 of NI 55-101.

No. See section 5.3 of NI 55-104 which states that the exemption in section 5.2 does not apply to an acquisition of options or similar securities granted to a director or officer.

{"metadata":"13905","text":"Background 1. ABC Inc. (the Issuer) is a reporting issuer in all provinces and territories.2. I am the CEO of the Issuer and therefore a reporting insider for this Issuer under NI 55-104. I did not hold any deferred share units (DSUs) when I became an insider of the Issuer.3. On March 15, 2010, I received a grant of 100 DSUs.4. The redemption value of a DSU is equal to the market value of a common share of the Issuer at the time of redemption, in accordance with the DSU Plan. The DSUs are cash-settled and do not provide for or permit settlement in securities of the Issuer. The DSUs do not entitle the holder to voting or other shareholder rights. The DSUs cannot be redeemed for cash until the holder has ceased to be a director, officer or employee of the Issuer.5. At the time of the grant, I confirmed that the DSUs do not, as a matter of law, constitute securities and are therefore not subject to the ordinary insider reporting requirements applicable to securities. I also confirmed that the Issuer has disclosed the existence and material terms of the DSU Plan in its circular and that I was therefore eligible for the reporting exemption in s. 2.2(b) of Multilateral Instrument 55-103 Insider Reporting for Certain Derivative Transactions (Equity Monetization) (MI 55-103) and, in British Columbia, Part 3 of BCI 55-506 Exemption from insider reporting requirements for certain derivative transactions (BCI 55-506).6. Accordingly, I did not file an insider report to report the grant of 100 DSUs on March 15, 2010.7. On April 30, 2010, NI 55-104 came into force.8. On May 15, 2010, I received a further grant of 100 DSUs.9. The Issuer has not filed an issuer grant report about this grant.Questions1. Do I need to file a report about the March grant of DSUs? If yes, when do I need to file it by? (For example, do I need to file it within 10 days of April 30, 2010?)2. Do I need to file a report about the May grant of DSUs? If yes, when do I need to file it by?3. If I need to file a report about the May grant, do I show a balance of 100 or 200 DSUs?Responses1. Assuming the DSUs are not securities, and the March grant was properly covered by the exemptions in MI 55-103 and BCI 55-506, you do not need to file an insider report about the March grant. Accordingly, there is no requirement to file a report about the March grant within 10 days of April 30, 2010. However, the next time there is a change in your holdings of DSUs (i.e., the May 15 grant), before you can report this change, you will first need to take a step to reflect the March grant in your holdings. We have set out below two methods for doing this. Either method is acceptable so long as you explain in the General Remarks section which method you are using.2. Assuming the DSUs are not securities, they would likely be considered related financial instruments under NI 55-104. Accordingly, you are required to file an insider report about the May grant within 10 days of the grant, or by May 25, 2010.Note: If the issuer files an issuer grant report about this grant on or before May 25, 2010, the deadline for the insider report is March 31, 2011. When filing this report, use nature of transaction code 56 “ grant of rights. See Part 6 of NI 55-104 for more information. Note: SEDI does not use the term related financial instrument. For the purposes of filing on SEDI, the term security applies to both securities and related financial instruments. 3. Before you can file a report about the May 15 grant of 100 DSUs, you will need to reflect the March 15 grant in your holdings. There are two methods for doing this. These are described below.In order to file an insider report about a grant of"}
{"metadata":"13905","text":"securities or related financial instruments, it is first necessarya. to confirm that the Issuer has created a security designation for this type of instrument, andb. record an Opening Balance on Initial Report for the DSUs.If the Issuer has not created a security designation for DSUs, you should contact the Issuer and request the Issuer to add the security designation to its issuer profile supplement. If the Issuer is unable to comply in a timely manner, you should contact the securities regulatory authority that is the principal regulator for the Issuer (generally, the securities regulatory authority in the jurisdiction where the Issuer's head office is located).Method 1 “ filing an opening balance that shows the March grant 4. Under this method, you can reflect the March grant in your opening balance. (If there are other prior grants of the same type of DSU, aggregate all such grants.)5. When you record an Opening Balance for the DSUs, you should include a remark in the General Remarks section to explain that you are using method 1. Failure to do this may result in the filing being misleading. For example,Opening balance for DSUs reflects grant of 100 DSUs on March 15, 2010. At the time of the grant, the grant was exempt from reporting requirements under Part 2 of MI 55-103 and Part 3 of BCI 55-506.Note: Ordinarily, the Opening Balance is intended to reflect the insider's holdings as of the date the insider became an insider. In this case, if the individual first became an insider on January 1, 2009, but did not receive any DSUs until the March 15, 2010 grant, then the record will be potentially misleading unless the insider also includes a comment in the general remarks section to explain that opening balance for DSUs reflects the grant of 100 DSUs on March 15, 2010. 6. When filing the insider report about the May 15, 2010 grant of DSUs, report the number of DSUs awarded and the equivalent number of underlying common shares. Use nature of transaction code 56 “ grant of rights.For more information, please refer to the section Insider Report for Deferred Share Units (DSU) or Restricted Share Awards in the online SEDI help.Method 2 “ notional adjusting transaction 7. Under this method, you would first file an opening balance of 0 for the DSUs.8. Then, prior to filing an insider report to reflect the May 15 grant of 100 DSUs, you would file a report to show a notional acquisition of the 100 DSUs that were granted on March 15, 2010. (If there are other prior grants of the same type of DSU, aggregate all such grants.)9. If this method is used, you should use the date of filing as the date of the notional acquisition, and not the actual date of acquisition (i.e., March 15, 2010) for the transaction date.Note: If you use the actual date of acquisition, or March 15, 2010, this may generate a late filing invoice. If this occurs, contact CSA staff in the jurisdiction which acts as principal regulator for the Issuer for assistance. 10. When you file the report about the notional acquisition, you should include a remark in the General Remarks section to explain that you are using method 2. Failure to do this may result in the filing being misleading. For example,Notional transaction to reflect grant of 100 DSUs on March 15, 2010. At the time of the grant, the grant was exempt from reporting requirements under Part 2 of MI 55-103 and Part 3 of BCI 55-506.Note: If you do not include an explanation in the general remarks section, this may suggest there was an actual acquisition of 100 DSUs on the date of filing (in addition to the grant of 100 DSUs granted on May 15, 2010). This may result in the public record being misleading. In addition, if the DSU exercise price is based on the share price on the actual date of grant (i.e., March 15, 2010), but the filing date is used as the transaction date without explanation in the general remarks section, this may suggest that DSUs have not been granted in accordance with the DSU plan.

{"metadata":"13906","text":"Background1. Same facts as in preceding FAQ.2. The Issuer has a dividend reinvestment plan (the DRIP) that provides that a holder of common shares may choose to receive additional common shares in lieu of cash dividends.3. On June 30, 2010, the Issuer declared a dividend on its common shares. Under the Issuer's DRIP, a holder of common shares would receive one additional common share for each 10 common shares held.4. Similarly, under the DSU Plan, additional DSUs are received as dividend equivalents. A participant in the DSU Plan cannot exercise any discretion in terms of the receipt of additional DSUs as dividend equivalents (i.e., the participant cannot choose between receiving DSUs or cash).5. Accordingly, on June 30, 2010, I received an additional 20 DSUs as a dividend on the 200 DSUs I currently hold.Question1. Do I need to file an insider report about the additional 20 DSUs received on June 30, 2010 within 10 days of the acquisition?Response1. If the issuer files an issuer grant report about a grant of DSUs after April 30, 2010, and the issuer grant report discloses, in addition to all other required information, the fact that each time the issuer issues common shares as dividends on its common shares, holders of DSUs will automatically receive corresponding DSUs as dividends, staff will accept that the exemption in section 6.2 of NI 55-104 is available for the issuance of the additional DSUs as dividend equivalents.2. In this case, the information required by section 6.3 will be readily determinable based on the issuer grant report and public disclosure by the issuer about the declaration of a dividend. You would need to file an alternative report by March 31, 2011 showing all DSUs received as dividend equivalents.3. Alternatively, so long as the reporting insider cannot exercise any discretion in terms of the issuance of additional DSUs as dividend equivalents under the DSU Plan, staff would accept that aspect of the DSU Plan as coming within the definition of automatic securities purchase plan for the purposes of Part 5 of NI 55-104. (Note that we would not accept that the DSU Plan generally constitutes an automatic plan for the purposes of the initial grant of DSUs under the Plan. This is because timely disclosure of grants of securities and similar instruments, whether through the insider reporting system or through the issuer filing an issuer grant report, can provide important information to investors and allows investors to monitor whether insiders may be causing issuers to engage in improper or unauthorized dating practices including backdating, spring-loading and bullet-dodging. See section 5.1 of Policy 55-104CP.)4. Accordingly, you can rely on the exemption in Part 5 of NI 55-104 for acquisitions of securities and related financial instruments under an automatic plan.

Failure to file an insider report in a timely manner or the filing of an insider report that contains information that is materially misleading may result in one or more of the following: in some jurisdictions, a late filing fee; the reporting insider being identified as a late filer on a public database of late filers maintained by certain securities regulators; the issuance of a cease trade order that prohibits the reporting insider from directly or indirectly trading in or acquiring securities or related financial instruments of the applicable reporting issuer or any reporting issuer until the failure to file is corrected or a specific period of time has elapsed; or in appropriate circumstances, enforcement proceedings.Securities regulators may also consider information relating to wilful, or repeated, noncompliance by directors and executive officers of a reporting issuer with their insider reporting obligations in the context of a prospectus review or continuous disclosure review.

The purpose of these provisions is to address concerns over directors and officers of a company proposing to acquire a significant interest in another company by unlawfully frontrunning the acquisition through personal purchases of shares of the second company.Section 3.5 of NI 55-104 requires the CEO, CFO, COO and every director of A Co to file insider reports in respect of transactions relating to securities and related financial instruments of B Co that occurred in the previous six months or for such shorter period that the individual was a CEO, CFO, COO or director of A Co.

See example below.If you are a reporting insider or otherwise required by securities legislation to file insider reports in respect of a SEDI issuer, but do not own or control securities or related financial instruments relating to that SEDI issuer, you do not need to file an insider profile until an insider report is required. However, if you wait until you are required to file an insider report, you must file your insider profile at the same time.Alternatively, you can set up and file your insider profile with a zero opening balance report (for each security, ownership type and registered holder combination) after you or your agent are registered as a SEDI user, but before any of your insider reports are due.Example: New Reporting Insider Question 1. On November 1, 2010, I became a director of ABC Inc. and therefore a reporting insider for this issuer under NI 55-104.2. I understand that, in accordance with section 3.2 of NI 55-104, I am required to file my initial report within 10 calendar days of becoming a reporting insider.

According to section 3.3 of NI 55-104, I am required to file an insider report within five calendar days of any change in my ownership or control of securities or interests in or rights or obligations associated with a related financial instrument. Accordingly, my insider report for this transaction would appear to be due on November 8, 2010.5. What is my deadline for the initial report? What is my deadline for reporting the purchase of 100 shares?Response 1. The deadline for filing the initial report would ordinarily be November 10, 2010. However, as a result of the purchase of 100 shares on November 3, 2010, the deadline for filing the initial report has effectively been accelerated to November 8, 2010. This is because, in order to be able to file an insider report about the purchase of 100 shares by the required due date of November 8, 2010, it will first be necessary to file the initial report.2.

Share-based compensation instruments, including phantom stock units, deferred share units (DSUs), restricted share awards (RSAs), performance share units (PSUs), stock appreciation rights (SARs) and similar instruments are also generally issuer derivatives. The issuer designates these derivatives in its issuer profile supplement. Third party derivatives are derivatives offered by someone other than the issuer. The price, value or payment obligations of third party derivatives are based on an underlying interest (such as common shares) issued by the issuer as the underlying security.

Under NI 55-104, it is not necessary to determine whether a particular derivative instrument is a security or a related financial instrument since the insider reporting requirement in Part 3 of NI 55-104 applies to both securities and related financial instruments. To the extent DSUs, RSAs and SARs do not, as a matter of law, constitute securities, they will generally be related financial instruments. RSAs and DSUs Step 1 - Grant of RSAs or DSUs: Report the number of RSAs or DSUs awarded and report the equivalent amount of underlying common shares using nature of transaction code 56 - Grant of rights. On SEDI, report the underlying common shares in the Equivalent number of underlying securities box. In SEDI, issuers should have created a security designation for the RSAs or DSUs in the issuer profile supplement, and selected the Issuer derivative category. Step 2 - Vesting and distribution of underlying common shares or cash: When the RSAs or DSUs vest and are settled in underlying common shares, report an acquisition of the relevant number of underlying common shares as one transaction using nature of transaction code 57 - Exercise of rights. You will also need to report a disposition of the corresponding number of the RSAs or DSUs, using nature of transaction code 57, as another transaction.When the RSAs or DSUs vest and are settled by a cash payment, report a disposition of the relevant number of the RSAs or DSUs using nature of transaction code 59 - Exercise for cash. SARs Step 1 - Grant of SARs Report the number of SARs awarded, and the exercise price, and report the equivalent amount of underlying common shares using nature of transaction code 56 - Grant of rights. Issuers should have created a security designation for the SARs in the issuer profile supplement, and selected the Issuer derivative category.Step 2 - Vesting and distribution of cashReport a disposition of the relevant number of SARs using nature of transaction code 59 Exercise for cash.

{"metadata":"14221","text":"Staff of the Ontario Securities Commission (staff or we) have recently received a number of questions on behalf of insiders who wish to establish an automatic securities disposition plan (sometimes referred to as a pre-arranged structured sales plan) (an ASDP) with their broker.We have compiled a list of the most frequently asked questions (the FAQs) and have set out our responses to such questions below.This notice represents staff's views on the interpretation of certain requirements of Ontario securities law that apply to ASDPs. Although the focus of this notice is on ASDPs, we would generally consider the views set out below as also being applicable to automatic securities purchase plans (ASPPs) as described in National Instrument 55-101 Insider Reporting Exemptions (NI 55-101). Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, a reference in this notice to a plan should be read as referring to both an ASDP and an ASPP.This notice is intended to be a temporary notice pending the development by staff of the Canadian Securities Administrators (the CSA) of a CSA Staff Notice in relation to ASDPs and similar plans generally. We expect that the proposed CSA Staff Notice will also address additional questions, such as the application of certain requirements of Canadian securities legislation to insiders who wish to establish a managed account where full discretionary authority over the securities in the account rests with the manager of the account. Questions relating to managed accounts are beyond the scope of this notice.In the meantime, we would remind issuers, insiders and other market participants that there may be differences in the securities law requirements of the other CSA jurisdictions that apply to automatic securities plans, and that the specific requirements of the other jurisdictions' securities legislation should be reviewed prior to establishing an ASDP or ASPP. Purpose"}
{"metadata":"14222","text":"We have recently received a number of enquiries on behalf of insiders who wish to establish an ASDP with their broker.These types of plans typically involve an insider instructing a broker to sell securities from the insider's holdings in accordance with a pre-arranged set of instructions. The plans typically contemplate that the broker will continue to sell the securities regardless of whether a blackout period established by the issuer may be in effect and regardless of whether the insider may be in possession of material undisclosed information about the issuer at the time of the sale. The most common questions that we have received in relation to ASDPs are as follows: Â If an insider sells securities of a reporting issuer under an ASDP at a time when the insider has knowledge of material undisclosed information about the issuer, can the insider rely on the exemption contained in subsection 175(2)(b) of the regulations? In other words, is an ASDP an other similar automatic plan for the purposes of the exemption in s. 175(2)(b), with the result that the insider is exempt from the prohibition in subsection 76(1) of the Act and liability under section 134 of the Act? Is there a disclosure obligation at the time the insider enters into the ASDP? Does the insider have to file an insider report each time there is a disposition under an ASDP? Or can the insider rely on the insider reporting exemption for automatic securities purchase plans (ASPPs) in NI 55-101 which allows an insider to file a report on an annual basis rather than a transaction-by-transaction basis?We Have Responded To These Questions As Follows. Background"}
{"metadata":"14223","text":"Although the exemption in s. 175(2)(b) refers to plans that are typically established by the issuer, staff take the view that this is not a necessary element under Ontario securities law, and an other similar automatic plan can include a plan established by an insider and the insider's broker, provided that the plan is automatic, as discussed below, and the other conditions to the exemption are satisfied. (It should be noted, however, that securities legislation in other jurisdictions may limit this exemption to plans established by the issuer.)We accept that a plan is automatic where the insider is able to demonstrate that the insider no longer has the ability to make decisions relating to trading in the securities in the plan and cannot make discrete investment decisions through the plan. (For more information on the concept of discrete investment decisions, please see, for example, sections 5.2 and 5.5 of the Companion Policy to NI 55-101).Accordingly, we will generally accept that a plan is an automatic plan for the purposes of s. 175(2)(b) of the regulations if it meets the following conditions:a) At the time of entry into the plan, the insider is not in possession of any material undisclosed information in relation to the issuer.b) At the time of entry into the plan, in the case of plans that have not been established by the issuer, the insider provides the broker with a certificate from the issuer confirming that the issuer is aware of the plan and certifying that, to the best of its knowledge, the insider is not in possession of material undisclosed information about the issuer.c) The trading parameters and other instructions are set out in a written plan document at the time of the establishment of the plan.d) The plan contains meaningful restrictions on the ability of the insider to vary, suspend or terminate the plan that have the effect of ensuring that the insider cannot profit from material undisclosed information through a decision to vary, suspend or terminate the plan.e) The plan provides that the broker is not permitted to consult with the insider regarding any sales under the plan and that the insider cannot disclose to the broker any information concerning the issuer that might influence the execution of the plan.f) The plan to purchase or sell securities was given or entered into in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the insider trading prohibitions.Where an insider's ability to vary, suspend or terminate the plan is not meaningfully restricted, we would likely question whether the plan may genuinely be regarded as an automatic plan for the purposes of s. 175(2)(b) of the regulations. This is because the insider retains discretionary authority over the securities in the plan and may be in a position to profit from material undisclosed information by varying, suspending or terminating the plan. For example, if an insider of an issuer establishes an ASDP and then comes into possession of material undisclosed information that is favourable to the issuer, the insider may profit from that information by terminating the plan. Similarly, if the insider comes into possession of material undisclosed information that is adverse to the issuer, the insider could vary the instructions to accelerate the dispositions. In both cases, we would likely take the view that the insider was making discrete investment decisions through the plan.Where a plan contains meaningful restrictions on the ability to vary, suspend or terminate the plan, we will generally accept that the plan is an automatic plan for the purposes of s. 175(2)(b). We have previously advised insiders and their advisers that a simple requirement that the insider represent to the broker that the insider is not in possession of material undisclosed information at the time of the variation, suspension or termination would likely not be sufficient. Meaningful restrictions could include, for example, a requirement that the insider notify the issuer and the public (via a SEDI filing) of a change in instructions which filing would include a representation that the insider is not in possession of any material undisclosed information. Is the Exemption in s. 175(2)(b) of the Regulations Available?"}
{"metadata":"14224","text":"Staff take the view that this will depend on the particular circumstances of the plan. In making this determination, the following questions should be considered: Where the plan is established by the issuer, the issuer should consider whether establishing the plan constitutes a material change, thereby triggering a news release and a material change report. Similarly, the issuer and the insider should consider whether the establishment of the plan constitutes a material fact, with the result that no person with knowledge of the material fact can trade so long as it has not been generally disclosed. In discussions with staff, insiders and their advisers have in some cases expressed the concern that public disclosure of the plan at the time the plan is established may have a negative impact on share price as it will indicate that a large block of securities may shortly come onto the market. We note that this concern would appear to suggest that the establishment of the plan constitutes a material change andor a material fact. The insider should consider whether entering into the arrangement involves a change in direct or indirect ... control or direction over the insider's securities. If yes, then an insider report is required at the time the arrangement is entered into by virtue of s. 107(2) of the Securities Act (Ontario). The insider should consider whether entering into the arrangement involves a change in the insider's economic interest in a security of the reporting issuer, or the insider's economic exposure to the reporting issuer. If yes, then entering into the arrangement will trigger a disclosure requirement under MI 55-103 Insider Reporting for Certain Derivative Transactions (Equity Monetization), unless an exemption in that instrument is available. Where the issuer and insider conclude that there is no legal requirement to disclose the existence of the plan at the time the plan is established, it may nevertheless be advisable to disclose the existence of the plan on a voluntary basis. Disclosure about the plan may eliminate questions about apparent trading activity by insiders during blackout periods and periods when the insiders may have access to material undisclosed information. Is there a Disclosure Obligation at the Time the Insider Enters Into the ASDP?"}
{"metadata":"14225","text":"Generally the insider (or the broker on behalf of the insider) will be required to file insider reports each time there is a disposition under an ASDP. We recommend that the insider include a statement in the general remarks section that the sale is pursuant to an ASDP.NI 55-101 allows for reporting on an annual basis for certain acquisitions of securities under an ASPP. As a result of recent amendments to NI 55-101, effective April 30, 2005, insiders can now report certain specified dispositions in connection with an ASPP on an annual basis. An ASDP is not an ASPP since it is designed to facilitate dispositions not acquisitions. However, if an insider wishes to make an application for exemptive relief, and is able to demonstrate that the plan is genuinely an automatic plan and the insider cannot make discrete investment decisions through the plan, staff may be prepared to recommend exemptive relief to allow the insider to file reports on an annual basis.

Significant Acquisition for Which No Business Acquisition Report is Filed"}
{"metadata":"9968","text":"(1) Subsection 10.2(2) of Form 44-101F1 requires prescribed disclosure of a proposed acquisition that has progressed to a state where a reasonable person would believe that the likelihood of the acquisition being completed is high and that would, if completed on the date of the short form prospectus, be a significant acquisition for the purposes of Part 8 of NI 51-102 . When interpreting the phrase where a reasonable person would believe that the likelihood of the acquisition being completed is high, it is our view that the following factors may be relevant in determining whether the likelihood of an acquisition being completed is high: (a) whether the acquisition has been publicly announced; (b) whether the acquisition is the subject of an executed agreement; and (c) the nature of conditions to the completion of the acquisition including any material third party consents required. The test of whether a proposed acquisition has progressed to a state where a reasonable person would believe that the likelihood of the acquisition being completed is high is an objective, rather than subjective, test in that the question turns on what a reasonable person would believe. It is not sufficient for an officer of an issuer to determine that he or she personally believes that the likelihood of the acquisition being completed is or is not high. The officer must form an opinion as to what a reasonable person would believe in the circumstances. In the event of a dispute, an objective test requires an adjudicator to decide whether a reasonable person would believe in the circumstances that the likelihood of an acquisition being completed was high. By contrast, if the disclosure requirement involved a subjective test, the adjudicator would assess an individual's credibility and decide whether the personal opinion of the individual as to whether the likelihood of the acquisition being completed was high was an honestly held opinion. Formulating the disclosure requirement using an objective test rather than a subjective test strengthens the basis upon which the regulator may object to an issuer's application of the test in particular circumstances.(2) Subsection 10.2(3) of Form 44-101F1 requires inclusion of the financial statements or other information relating to certain acquisitions or proposed acquisitions if the inclusion of the financial statements or other information is necessary in order for the short form prospectus to contain full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities being distributed. We generally presume that the inclusion of financial statements or other information is required for all acquisitions that are, or would be, significant under Part 8 of NI 51-102 . Issuers can rebut this presumption if they can provide evidence that the financial statements or other information are not required for full, true and plain disclosure. Subsection 10.2(4) of Form 44-101F1 provides that issuers must satisfy the requirements of subsection 10.2(3) of Form 44-101F1 by including either: (i) the financial statements or other information that would be required by Part 8 of NI 51-102 ; or (ii) satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information. Satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information may be provided to satisfy the requirements of subsection 10.2(3) when the financial statements or other information that would be required by Part 8 of NI 51-102 relate to a financial year ended within 90 days before the date of the prospectus or an interim period ended within 60"}
{"metadata":"9968","text":"days before the date of the prospectus for issuers that are venture issuers, and 45 days for issuers that are not venture issuers. In these circumstances, we believe that satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information would not have to include any financial statements or other information for the acquisition or probable acquisition related to: (a) a financial year ended within 90 days before the date of the short form prospectus; or (b) an interim period ended within 60 days before the date of the short form prospectus for issuers that are venture issuers, and 45 days for issuers that are not venture issuers. An example of satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information that we will generally find acceptable would be: (c) comparative annual financial statements or other information for the acquisition or probable acquisition for at least the number of financial years as would be required under Part 8 of NI 51-102 that ended more than 90 days before the date of the short form prospectus, audited for the most recently completed financial period in accordance with NI 52-107 , and reviewed for the comparative period in accordance with section 4.3 of NI 44-101; (d) a comparative interim financial report or other information for the acquisition or probable acquisition for any interim period ended subsequent to the latest annual financial statements included in the short form prospectus and more than 60 days before the date of the short form prospectus for issuers that are venture issuers, and 45 days for issuers that are not venture issuers reviewed in accordance with section 4.3 of NI 44-101; and (e) pro forma financial statements or other information required under Part 8 of NI 51-102 . If the issuer intends to include financial statements as set out in the example above as satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information, we ask that this be highlighted in the cover letter to the prospectus. If the issuer does not intend to include financial statements or other information, or intends to file financial statements or other information that are different from those set out above, we encourage the utilization of pre-filing procedures.(3) When an issuer acquires a business or related businesses that has itself recently acquired another business or related businesses (an indirect acquisition), the issuer should consider whether prospectus disclosure about the indirect acquisition, including historical financial statements, is necessary to satisfy the requirement that the prospectus contain full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities being distributed. In making this determination, the issuer should consider the following factors:  if the indirect acquisition would meet any of the significance tests in Part 8 of NI 51-102 when the issuer applies each of those tests to its proportionate interest in the indirect acquisition of the business; and  if the amount of time between the separate acquisitions is such that the effect of the first acquisition is not adequately reflected in the results of the business or related businesses the issuer is acquiring.Â  (4) Subsection 10.2(3) discusses financial statements or other information for the completed or proposed acquisition of the business or related businesses. This other information is intended to capture the financial information disclosures required under Part 8 of NI 51-102 other than financial statements. An example of other information would include the operating statements, property descriptions, production volumes and reserves disclosures described under section 8.10 of NI 51-102 .

{"metadata":"9971","text":"If an issuer has filed annual financial statements or interim financial report for periods that are more recent than those that the issuer must otherwise include in a long form prospectus before it files the prospectus, sections 32.6 and 35.8 of Form 41-101F1 require the issuer to include those financial statements in the long form prospectus. Issuers should update the disclosure in the prospectus accordingly in order to satisfy the requirement that the long form prospectus contain full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities being distributed. However, if historical financial information derived from more recent annual financial statements or interim financial report is released to the public by the issuer before the financial statements are filed, the prospectus should include the information included in the news release or public communication. There is no specific requirement in the Instrument to otherwise update the prospectus, or pro forma financial statements to reflect the more recent information. We think the directors of an issuer should endeavor to consider and approve financial statements in a timely manner and should not delay the approval and filing of the financial statements for the purpose of avoiding their inclusion in a long form prospectus. Once the directors have approved an issuer's financial statements, the issuer should file them as soon as possible. General financial statement requirements"}
{"metadata":"9972","text":"(1) An issuer is required to provide historical financial statements under Item 32 of Form 41-101F1 for a business or related businesses that a reasonable investor would regard as the primary business of the issuer. However, if the issuer is a reporting issuer whose principal assets are not cash, cash equivalents or an exchange listing, and the acquisition of the primary business represents a significant acquisition for the issuer, the reporting issuer is subject to the requirements of Item 35 in respect of the financial statement and other disclosure for the acquisition.An acquisition does not include a reverse takeover, as defined in NI 41-101 which cross-references the meaning of acquisition as used in Part 8 of NI 51-10 2. Therefore a reporting issuer cannot rely on the exemption in subsection 32.1(2) if the applicable transaction is a reverse takeover. Examples of when a reasonable investor would regard the primary business of the issuer to be the acquired business or related businesses, thereby triggering the application of Item 32, are when the acquisition(s) was (a) a reverse takeover, (b) a qualifying transaction for a Capital Pool Company, or (c) an acquisition that is a significant acquisition at over the 100% level under sub section 35.1(4) of Form 41-101F1 . The issuer should consider the facts of each situation to determine whether a reasonable investor would regard the primary business of the issuer to be the acquired business or related businesses.(2) The periods for which the issuer must provide financial statements under Item 32 of Form 41-101F1 for an acquired business or businesses that are regarded as the primary business of the issuer should be determined in reference to sections 32.2 and 32.3 of Form 41-101F1, and with the same exceptions, where applicable, set out in paragraphs 32.4 (a) through (e) of Form 41-101F1. For example, for an issuer that is a reporting issuer in at least one jurisdiction immediately before filing a long form prospectus, the reference to three years in subparagraph 32.2 (6)(a) of Form 41-101F1 should be read as two years under paragraphs 32.4 (a), (b), (d) and (e) of Form 41-101F1.The issuer must also consider the necessity of including pro forma financial statements pursuant to section 32.7 of Form 41-101F1 to illustrate the impact of the acquisition of the primary business on the issuer's financial position and results of operations. For additional guidance, an issuer should refer to section 5.10 of this Policy. Interpretation of issuer - primary business"}
{"metadata":"9973","text":"(1) An issuer is required to provide historical financial statements under Item 32 of the Form 41-101F1 for any predecessor entity. This includes financial statements of acquired businesses that are unrelated and not otherwise individually significant, but together form the basis of the business of the issuer. However, if the issuer is a reporting issuer whose principal assets are not cash, cash equivalents or an exchange listing, and the acquisition of the predecessor entity represents a significant acquisition for the issuer, the reporting issuer is subject to the requirements of Item 35 in respect of the financial statement and other disclosure for the acquisition.The issuer must also consider the necessity of including pro forma financial statements pursuant to section 32.7 of Form 41-101F1 to illustrate the impact of the acquisition of the predecessor entity on the issuer's financial position and results of operations. For additional guidance, an issuer should refer to section 5.10 of this Policy.(2) If an issuer determines the financial statements of certain acquired businesses referred to in subsection (1) are not relevant, the issuer should utilize the pre-filing procedures in NP 11-202 to determine whether it would require an exemption from the requirement to include these financial statements. Interpretation of issuer - predecessor entity"}
{"metadata":"9974","text":"(1) Item 32 of Form 41-101F1 prescribes the issuer financial statements that must be included in a long form prospectus. We recognize that an issuer, at the time of filing a long form prospectus, may have been in existence for less than one year. We expect that in many situations the limited historical financial statement information that is available for such an issuer may be adequately supplemented by other relevant information disclosed in the long form prospectus. However, if the issuer cannot provide financial statements for a period of at least 12 months and the long form prospectus does not otherwise contain information concerning the business conducted or to be conducted by the issuer that is sufficient to enable an investor to make an informed investment decision, a securities regulatory authority or regulator may consider this a key factor when deciding whether it should refuse to issue a receipt for the long form prospectus.(2) A reference to a prospectus includes a preliminary prospectus. Consequently, the time references in sections 32.2 , 32.3 , 35.5 and 35.6 of Form 41-101F1 should be considered as at the date of the preliminary long form prospectus and again at the date of the final long form prospectus for both the issuer and any business acquired or to be acquired. Depending on the period of time between the dates of the preliminary and final long form prospectuses, an issuer may have to include more recent financial statements.(3) An issuer is subject to certain additional disclosure requirements when it discloses an interim financial report for a period in the year of adopting IFRS, as set out in subparagraph 32.3 (2)(e) and subsection 32.3 (4) of Form 41-101F1. These requirements only apply to interim financial reports relating to periods in the year of adopting IFRS and therefore do not apply if the prospectus includes annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. An issuer is required to provide an opening IFRS statement of financial position at the date of transition to IFRS. An issuer with, for example, a year-end of December 31, 2010 that files a prospectus for which it must include its first interim financial report in the year of adopting IFRS for the period ended March 31, 2011, must generally provide an opening IFRS statement of financial position at January 1, 2010.An issuer must also include various reconciliations required by IFRS 1 to explain how the transition from previous GAAP to IFRS has affected its reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows. In the first interim period IFRS 1 requires certain additional reconciliations which relate to annual periods and the date of transition to IFRS. Where an issuer that was not a reporting issuer in at least one jurisdiction immediately before filing the prospectus includes an interim financial report in respect of the second or third interim period in the year of adopting IFRS, subsection 32.3 (4) of Form 41-101F1 requires these additional reconciliations to be included in the prospectus. Alternatively, pursuant to subsection 32.3 (4) of Form 41-101F1, the issuer may include the first interim financial report in the year of adopting IFRS as this report includes the required reconciliations.These additional reconciliations may be summarized as follows:  reconciliations of the issuer's equity presented in accordance with previous GAAP to its equity in accordance with IFRS for the date of transition to IFRS (January 1, 2010 in the above-noted example);  reconciliations of the issuer's equity presented in accordance with previous GAAP to its equity in accordance with IFRS for the end of the latest period presented in the issuer's most recent annual financial statements in accordance with previous GAAP (December 31, 2010 in the above-noted example); and  a reconciliation of the issuer's total comprehensive income (or total profit or loss) presented in accordance with previous GAAP to its total comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS for the latest period in the issuer's most recent annual financial statements presented in the prospectus in accordance with previous GAAP (year ended December 31, 2010 in the above-noted example).The reconciliations summarized above must give sufficient detail to enable investors to understand the material adjustments to the statement of financial position, statement of comprehensive income and statement of cash flows.

(a) In this case, as a condition of granting the exemption, the issuer may be requested by a securities regulatory authority or regulator to (i) represent in writing to the securities regulatory authority or regulator, no later than the time the preliminary long form prospectus is filed, that the issuer made every reasonable effort to obtain copies of, or reconstruct, the historical accounting records necessary to prepare and audit the financial statements, but such efforts were unsuccessful, and (ii) disclose in the long form prospectus the fact that the historical accounting records have been destroyed and cannot be reconstructed. The issuer has emerged from bankruptcy and current management is denied access to the historical accounting records necessary to audit the financial statements. (b) In this case, as a condition of granting the exemption, the issuer may be requested by a securities regulatory authority or regulator to (i) represent in writing to the securities regulatory authority or regulator, no later than the time the preliminary long form prospectus is filed, that the issuer has made every reasonable effort to obtain access to, or copies of, the historical accounting records necessary to audit the financial statements but that such efforts were unsuccessful, and (ii) disclose in the long form prospectus the fact that the issuer has emerged from bankruptcy and current management is denied access to the historical accounting records. The issuer has undergone a fundamental change in the nature of its business or operations affecting a majority of its operations and all, or substantially all, of the executive officers and directors of the company have changed. (c) The evolution of a business or progression along a development cycle will not be considered to be a fundamental change in an issuer's business or operations. Relief from the requirement to include financial statements of the issuer required by the Instrument for the year in which the change occurred, or for the most recently completed financial year if the change in operations occurred during the issuer's current financial year, generally will not be granted.

Completed significant acquisitions and the obligation to provide business acquisition report level disclosure for a non-reporting issuer (2) For an issuer that is not a reporting issuer in any jurisdiction immediately before filing the long form prospectus (a non-reporting issuer), the long form prospectus disclosure requirements for a significant acquisition are generally intended to mirror those for reporting issuers subject to Part 8 of NI 51-102 . To determine whether an acquisition is significant, non-reporting issuers would first look to the guidance under section 8.3 of NI 51-102 . The initial test for significance would be calculated based on the financial statements of the issuer and acquired business or related businesses for the most recently completed financial year of each that ended before the acquisition date.To recognize the possible growth of a non-reporting issuer between the date of its most recently completed year end and the acquisition date and the corresponding potential decline in significance of the acquisition to the issuer, issuers should refer to the guidance in paragraph 35.1 (4)(b) of Form 41-101F1 to perform the optional test. The applicable time period for this optional test for the issuer is the most recently completed interim period or financial year for which financial statements of the issuer are included in the prospectus and for the acquired business or related businesses is the most recently completed interim period or financial year ended before the date of the long form prospectus.The significance thresholds for IPO venture issuers are identical to the significance thresholds for venture issuers.The timing of the disclosure requirements set out in subsection 35.3 (1) of Form 41-101F1 are based on the principles under section 8.2 of NI 51-102 . For reporting issuers, subsection 8.2 (2) of NI 51-102 sets out the timing of disclosures for significant acquisitions where the acquisition occurs within 45 days after the year end of the acquired business. However, for IPO venture issuers, paragraph 35.3 (1)(d) imposes a disclosure requirement for all significant acquisitions completed more than 90 days before the date of the long form prospectus, where the acquisition occurs within 45 days after the year end of the acquired business. This differs from the business acquisition report filing deadline for venture issuers under paragraph 8.2 (2)(b) of NI 51-102 where the business acquisition report deadline for any significant acquisition where the acquisition occurs within 45 days after the year end of the acquired business is within 120 days after the acquisition date. Probable acquisitions (3) When interpreting the phrase where a reasonable person would believe that the likelihood of the acquisition being completed is high, it is our view that the following factors may be relevant in determining whether the likelihood of an acquisition being completed is high: (a) whether the acquisition has been publicly announced; (b) whether the acquisition is the subject of an executed agreement; (c) the nature of"}
{"metadata":"9978","text":"conditions to the completion of the acquisition including any material third party consents required. The test of whether a proposed acquisition has progressed to a state where a reasonable person would believe that the likelihood of the acquisition being completed is high is an objective, rather than subjective, test in that the question turns on what a reasonable person would believe. It is not sufficient for an officer of an issuer to determine that he or she personally believes that the likelihood of the acquisition being completed is or is not high. The officer must form an opinion as to what a reasonable person would believe in the circumstances. In the event of a dispute, an objective test requires an adjudicator to decide whether a reasonable person would believe in the circumstances that the likelihood of an acquisition being completed was high. By contrast, if the disclosure requirement involved a subjective test, the adjudicator would assess an individual's credibility and decide whether the personal opinion of the individual as to whether the likelihood of the acquisition being completed was high was an honestly held opinion. Formulating the disclosure requirement using an objective test rather than a subjective test strengthens the basis upon which the regulator may object to an issuer's application of the test in particular circumstances.We generally presume that the inclusion of financial statements or other information is required for all acquisitions that are, or would be, significant under Part 8 of NI 51-102 . Reporting issuers can rebut this presumption if they can provide evidence that the financial statements or other information are not required for full, true and plain disclosure. Satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information (4) Issuers must satisfy the disclosure requirements in section 35.5 or section 35.6 of Form 41-101F1 by including either: (i) the financial statements or other information that would be required by Part 8 of NI 51-102 ; or (ii) satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information. Satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information may be provided to satisfy the requirements of subsection 35.5 (3) or subsection 35.6 (3) of Form 41-101F1 when the financial statements or other information that would be required by Part 8 of NI 51-102 relate to a financial year ended within 90 days before the date of the long form prospectus or an interim period ended within 60 days before the date of the long form prospectus for issuers that are venture issuers, and 45 days for issuers that are not venture issuers. In these circumstances, we believe that satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information would not have to include any financial statements or other information for the acquisition or probable acquisition related to: (a) a financial year ended within 90 days before the date of the long form prospectus; or (b) an interim period ended within 60 days before the date of the long form prospectus for issuers that are venture issuers, and 45 days for issuers that are not venture issuers. An example of satisfactory alternative financial statements or other information that we will generally find acceptable would be: (c) comparative annual financial statements or other information for the acquisition or probable acquisition for at least the number of financial years as would be required under Part 8 of NI 51-102 that ended more than 90 days before the date of the long form prospectus, audited for the most recently completed financial period in accordance with section 4.2 of the Instrument, and reviewed for the comparative period in accordance with section 4.3 of the Instrument; (d) a comparative interim financial report or other information for the acquisition or probable acquisition for any interim period ended subsequent to the latest annual financial statements included in the long form prospectus and more than 60 days before the date of the long form prospectus for issuers that are venture issuers, and 45 days for issuers that are not venture issuers reviewed in accordance with section 4.3 of the Instrument; and (e) pro forma financial statements or other information required under Part 8 of NI 51-102 . If the issuer intends to include financial statements as set out in the example above as satisfactory alternative financial statements, we ask that this be highlighted in the cover letter to the long form prospectus. If the issuer does not intend to include financial statements or other information, or intends to file financial statements or other information that are different from those set out above, the issuer should use the pre-filing procedures in NP 11-202. Acquired business has recently completed an acquisition (5) When an issuer acquires a business or related businesses that has itself recently acquired another business or related businesses (an indirect acquisition), the issuer should consider whether long form prospectus disclosure about the indirect acquisition, including historical financial statements, is necessary to satisfy the requirement that the long form prospectus contain full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities being distributed. In making this determination, the issuer should consider the following factors:  if the indirect acquisition would meet any of the significance tests in section 35.1 (4) of Form 41-101F1 when the issuer applies each of those tests to its proportionate interest in the indirect acquisition of the business;  if the amount of time between the separate acquisitions is such that the effect of the first acquisition is not adequately reflected in the results of the business or related businesses the issuer is acquiring. Financial statements or other information (6) Paragraphs 35. 5(2)(b) and 35.6 (2)(b) discuss financial statements or other information for the acquired business or related businesses. This other information is intended to capture the financial information disclosures required under Part 8 of NI 51-102 other than financial statements. An example of other information would include the operating statements, property descriptions, production volumes and reserves disclosures described under section 8.10 of NI 51-102 .(7) Section 3.11 of NI 52-107 permits acquisition statements included in a business acquisition report or prospectus to be prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP applicable to private enterprises in certain circumstances. The ability to present acquisition statements using Canadian GAAP applicable to private enterprises would not extend to a situation where an entity acquired or to be acquired is considered the primary business or the predecessor of the issuer and the issuer must provide financial statements for this acquisition under Item 32.

{"metadata":"9979","text":"(1) The financial statements for acquisitions of a predecessor entity, a business or businesses acquired by the issuer, or other entity must be included in the prospectus under Item 32 of Form 41-101F 1, if the entities or businesses satisfy the conditions of paragraph 32.1 (1)(a), (b), or (c) unless, as contemplated in subsection 32.1 (2) with respect to paragraph 32.1 (1)(a) or (b) (a) the issuer was a reporting issuer in any jurisdiction of Canada on the acquisition date in the case of a completed acquisition or immediately prior to the prospectus filing in the case of a proposed acquisition, (b) the issuer did not have only cash, cash equivalents or an exchange listing as its principal asset, and (c) the issuer provides disclosure under Item 35 of Form 41-101F1 . The disclosure requirements applicable to a reporting issuer in Item 35 are intended to reflect the requirements that would be prescribed for such acquisitions in the reporting issuer's business acquisition report. (2) An issuer that is subject to Item 32 must also consider the necessity of including pro forma financial statements pursuant to section 32.7 of Form 41-101F1 to illustrate the impact of the acquisition on the issuer's financial position and results of operations. However, these pro forma financial statements are only required if their inclusion is necessary for the prospectus to contain full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the securities being distributed. Examples of when pro forma financial statements would likely be necessary are in cases where: (a) the issuer has acquired multiple businesses over the relevant period; or (b) the issuer has an active business and has acquired another business that will constitute its primary business going forward. In certain circumstances, an issuer may need to disclose multiple acquisitions in its prospectus where the acquisitions include an acquisition of a primary business or predecessor entity to which section 32.1 of Form 41-101F1 applies and a significant acquisition to which only item 35 of Form 41-101F1 applies. In this case, the issuer may wish to present one set of pro forma financial statements reflecting the results of all of the acquisitions, as contemplated separately in each of sections 32.8 and 35.7 of Form 41-101F1. The securities regulatory authority or regulator would not generally object to providing this relief. However the issuer must request the relief when filing its preliminary prospectus.

(c) The Profit or Loss Test . The specified profit or loss calculated under the following subparagraph (i) exceeds 20 percent of the specified profit or loss calculated under the following subparagraph (ii): (i) the reporting issuer's proportionate share of the consolidated specified profit or loss of the business or related businesses for the later of (A) the most recently completed financial year of the business or related businesses; or (B) the 12 months ended on the last day of the most recently completed interim period of the business or related businesses; (ii) the reporting issuer's consolidated specified profit or loss for the later of (A) the most recently completed financial year, without giving effect to the acquisition; or (B) the 12 months ended on the last day of the most recently completed interim period of the reporting issuer, without giving effect to the acquisition.

At what stage in the prospectus process should the prospectus be pre-filed? To use the pre-file process, we expect the terms and conditions of the offering, and any related transactions, to be clearly determined. We also expect that the underwriters would have substantially completed their review of the pre-filed prospectus. Staff expect the pre-filed prospectus generally to be of the same form and quality as if it was the publicly filed preliminary prospectus, and contain the disclosure (including financial statements) prescribed under securities legislation and described in the form of prospectus that the issuer intends to use. ...If staff determine that the pre-filed prospectus is materially non-compliant or incomplete, the principal regulator will stop the review and ask the filer to file a revised draft with the necessary information. This will likely delay the review. In the event staff do not receive a response within a reasonable period of time, they may advise the filer that the pre-file will be closed unless a response to the request for information or comment letter is received by a specified date.

{"metadata":"12346","text":"(1) It is not unusual for analysts to ask corporate officers to review earnings estimates that they are preparing. A company takes on a high degree of risk of violating securities legislation if it selectively confirms that an analyst's estimate is on target or that an analyst's estimate is too high or too low, whether directly or indirectly through implied guidance. [FN 34](2) Even when confirming information previously made public, a company needs to consider whether the selective confirmation itself communicates information above and beyond the initial forecast and whether the additional information is material. This will depend in large part on how much time has passed between the original statement and the company's confirmation, as well as the timing of the two statements relative to the end of the company's fiscal period. For example, a selective confirmation of expected earnings near the end of a quarter is likely to represent guidance (as it may well be based on how the company actually performed). Materiality of a confirmation may also depend on intervening events. [FN 35](3) One way companies can try to ensure that analyst's estimates are in line with their own expectations is through the regular and timely public dissemination of qualitative and quantitative information.

Having your board or audit committee review such disclosure in advance of its public release acts as a good discipline on management and helps to increase the quality, credibility and objectivity of such disclosures. This review process also helps to force a critical examination of all issues related to the disclosure and reduces the risk of having to make subsequent adjustments or amendments to the information it contains.(2) Where feasible, issue your earnings news release [FN 39] concurrently with the filing of your quarterly or annual financial statements. This will help to ensure that a complete financial picture is available to analysts and investors at the time the earnings release is provided. Coordinating the release of a company's earnings information with the filing of its quarterly or annual financial statements will also facilitate review of these disclosures by the board or audit committee of the company. [FN 40] FN 38 Some provinces require that annual financial statements be reviewed by a company's audit committee (if the company has an audit committee) before board approval. A board of directors must also review interim financial statements before they are filed and distributed. In the case of interim financial statements, boards are permitted to delegate this review function to the audit committee (see for example, OSC Rule 52-501 Financial Statements). Where such a requirement exists at law, we believe that extracting information from financial statements that have not been reviewed by the board or audit committee and releasing that information to the marketplace in a news release is inconsistent with the prior review requirement. FN 39 Companies often issue news releases announcing corporate earnings which highlight major items and may include pro forma results. FN 40 Certain jurisdictions impose a requirement to concurrently deliver to shareholders financial statements that are filed. This may militate against the early filing of annual financial statements to avoid the cost of mailing them twice, once at the time of early filing and subsequently as part of the company's annual report.

A reporting issuer may determine that its obligation to provide full, true and plain disclosure obliges it to include in its prospectus reserves data and other oil and gas information as at a date more recent than specified in the prospectus requirements. The prospectus requirements state that the information must be as at the reporting issuer's most recent financial year-end in respect of which the prospectus includes financial statements. CSA staff may consider granting relief on a case-by-case basis to permit a reporting issuer in these circumstances to include in its prospectus the oil and gas information prepared with an effective date more recent than the financial yearend date, without also including the corresponding information effective as at the year-end date. A consideration for granting this relief may include disclosure of Form 51-101F1 information with an effective date that coincides with the date of interim financial statements.

While NI 51-102 does not require an issuer to engage its auditor to review its interim financial report, it does however require an issuer to disclose in an accompanying notice if an interim review has not been performed by its auditor. We found a significant level of non-compliance with this disclosure requirement and in these cases, issuers were requested to refile their interim financial statements with the required disclosure.The purpose of this notice is to summarize the results of our review and to clarify the securities law requirements relating to an auditor's involvement with interim financial reports. As well, we have provided further guidance on the review requirements for an issuer's first interim financial report prepared following its transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Issuers and their advisors should take this notice into account when assessing the extent to which future disclosure meets the requirements of securities legislation and their investors' need for transparent disclosure. Investors need to be properly informed about an auditor's level of involvement with an issuer's interim financial report given that auditor involvement levels will continue to vary amongst issuers. Introduction"}
{"metadata":"12483","text":"When an issuer has not engaged its auditor to perform a review, it is critical that the issuer clearly disclose this fact in a notice accompanying its interim financial report. This disclosure is important as it alerts investors and other users of the financial statements that the issuer's auditor did not complete a review of the interim financial report. With this disclosure, users of financial statements are able to determine the amount of reliance they may place on an issuer's interim financial report when deciding to buy or sell investments throughout the year. Investor Impact"}
{"metadata":"12484","text":"We reviewed a sample of 72 issuers, comprised of 28 non-venture and 44 venture issuers, where it appeared that the interim financial statements had been reviewed by its auditor. We asked these issuers to confirm that their interim financial statements had been reviewed in accordance with securities legislation and Section 7050 auditor review of interim financial statements (Section 7050) of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants Handbook (the Handbook).Overall, we found that 35% of the issuers reviewed, consisting of four non-venture and 21 venture issuers, did not comply with the disclosure requirements relating to an auditor's involvement with interim financial statements. Specifically, 48% of venture issuers and 14% of non-venture issuers selected, confirmed that an auditor did not perform a review of its interim financial statements and yet these statements were not accompanied by a notice indicating that fact. Given the importance of this information to investors, we requested that these issuers refile their third quarter interim financial statements with the disclosure that its previously filed interim financial statements were not reviewed by its auditor. The reasons cited for noncompliance by issuers included a general lack of awareness about their disclosure obligations or confusion about what would constitute a review under securities legislation and Section 7050 of the Handbook. To improve the level of compliance going forward, we have highlighted below the relevant securities law requirements relating to an auditor's involvement with interim financial reports. Review Results"}
{"metadata":"12485","text":"An issuer is not required to engage its auditor to review its interim financial report for the purposes of fulfilling its continuous disclosure obligations under NI 51-102. As depicted in the chart below however, subsection 4.3(3) of NI 51-102 requires a reporting issuer to disclose if an auditor has not performed a review of the interim financial report, to disclose if an auditor was unable to complete a review and why, and to file a written report from the auditor if the auditor has performed a review and expressed a reservation in the auditor's interim review report. As the white box in the chart shows, the only time that disclosure is not required is when an auditor has performed a review and has not expressed a reservation in the auditor's interim review report. The term review refers to a review engagement where the auditor reports to the issuer's audit committee on the results of a review of the issuer's interim financial report for all of the periods presented in the report and in accordance with Section 7050 of the Handbook. (If a reporting issuer's financial statements are audited in accordance with auditing standards other than Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, the corresponding review standards should be applied.) Where an auditor has been retained to perform limited review procedures or to review only certain components of an issuer's interim financial report, this would not constitute a review and we would require disclosure of a notice indicating that the interim financial report has not been reviewed by the auditor. While NI 51-102 does not prescribe the format of this notice, issuers typically provide this disclosure on a separate page appearing immediately before the interim financial report. Continuous Disclosure Obligations"}
{"metadata":"12486","text":"Issuers should note that we did not make any changes to the requirements for the level of auditor involvement with issuers' interim financial reports as part of our IFRS-related rule amendments to NI 51-102. However, if an issuer engages its external auditor to review its first IFRS interim financial report, we remind issuers and their auditors that all financial statements and notes presented are subject to that review. Therefore, for the first IFRS interim financial report this review will have to include, in addition to the current and comparative period results, the opening IFRS statement of financial position and all IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards reconciliations presented in the notes. To the extent a review of all components of the interim financial report is not completed, the interim financial report will need to be accompanied by a notice indicating that it has not been reviewed by the issuer's auditor. Issuers should consider the extra time that may be needed by its auditor to review the additional information in the first IFRS interim financial report when coordinating the timing of the review. Review of the First IFRS Interim Financial Report"}
{"metadata":"12487","text":"We will continue to monitor issuers' compliance with the disclosure requirements relating to the auditor's involvement with interim financial reports as part of our overall continuous disclosure review program. We urge issuers and their audit committee members to consult with their auditor to confirm the scope of the auditor's review engagement, to establish whether the review of the interim financial report will be completed in accordance with Section 7050 of the Handbook and to determine whether a notice is required to be attached to its interim financial report. Auditors may also wish to consider how an issuer is communicating their level of involvement with the interim financial report given that an omission of disclosure implies that the report has been reviewed when a review engagement may not have been performed. We believe that investors need to be able to discern the level of auditor involvement in an issuer's interim financial report when making investment decisions, and as such, staff will continue to request re-filings of this report when an issuer has not met its disclosure obligations in this area.

This discussion is only required if the reporting issuer previously disclosed the forward-looking information to the public.

In its md&a for the second quarter, the reporting issuer should discuss the interest rate increase and its expected effect on results compared to those indicated in the FOFI.A reporting issuer should consider whether the events and circumstances that trigger md&a disclosure under subsection 5.8(2) of the Instrument might also trigger material change reporting requirements under Part 7 of the Instrument.(2) Subsection 5.8(4) of the Instrument requires a reporting issuer to disclose and discuss material differences between actual results for the annual or interim period to which its md&a relates and any FOFI or financial outlook for that period that the reporting issuer previously disclosed to the public.

This certification is not qualified by the phrase in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which is typically included in audit reports accompanying annual financial statements. The forms specifically exclude this qualification to prevent certifying officers from relying entirely on compliance with the issuer's GAAP in this representation, particularly as the issuer's GAAP financial statements might not fully reflect the financial condition of the issuer.

As a result, certifying officers cannot limit the fair presentation representation by referring to the issuer's GAAP.

Nevertheless, certifying officers of the issuer must retain overall responsibility for the design and resulting MD&A disclosure concerning the issuer's DC&P and ICFR. Delegation Permitted in Certain Cases"}
{"metadata":"12671","text":"(1) Approaches to consider for design - The Instrument does not prescribe the approach certifying officers should use to design the issuer's DC&P or ICFR. However, we believe that a top-down, risk-based approach is an efficient and cost-effective approach that certifying officers should consider. This approach allows certifying officers to avoid unnecessary time and effort designing components of DC&P and ICFR that are not required to obtain reasonable assurance. Alternatively, certifying officers might use some other approach to design, depending on the issuer's size, nature of business and complexity of operations. (2) Top-down, risk-based approach - Under a top-down, risk-based approach to designing DC&P and ICFR certifying officers first identify and assess risks faced by the issuer in order to determine the scope and necessary complexity of the issuer's DC&P or ICFR. A top-down, risk- based approach helps certifying officers to focus their resources on the areas of greatest risk and avoid expending unnecessary resources on areas with little or no risk. Under a top-down, risk-based approach, certifying officers initially consider risks without considering any existing controls of the issuer. Using this approach to design DC&P, the certifying officers identify the risks that could, individually or in combination with others, reasonably result in a material misstatement in its annual filings, interim filings or other reports filed or submitted by it under securities legislation. Using this approach to design ICFR, the certifying officers identify those risks that could, individually or in combination with others, reasonably result in a material misstatement of the financial statements (financial reporting risks). A material misstatement includes misstatements due to error, fraud or omission in disclosure. Identifying risks involves considering the size and nature of the issuer's business and the structure and complexity of business operations. If an issuer has multiple locations or business units, certifying officers initially identify the risks that could reasonably result in a material misstatement and then consider the significance of these risks at individual locations or business units. If the officers identify a risk that could reasonably result in a material misstatement, but the risk is either adequately addressed by controls, policies or procedures that operate centrally or is not present at an individual location or business unit, then certifying officers do not need to focus their resources at that location or business unit to address the risk. For the design of DC&P, the certifying officers assess risks for various types and methods of disclosure. For the design of ICFR, identifying risks involves identifying significant accounts and disclosures and their relevant assertions. After identifying risks that could reasonably result in a material misstatement, the certifying officers then ensure that the DC&P and ICFR designs include controls, policies and procedures to address each of the identified risks. (3) Fraud risk - When identifying risks, certifying officers should explicitly consider the vulnerability of the entity to fraudulent activity (e.g., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets). Certifying officers should consider how incentives (e.g., compensation programs) and pressures (e.g., meeting analysts' expectations) might affect risks, and what areas of the business provide opportunity for an individual to commit fraud. For the purposes of this Instrument, fraud would generally include an intentional act by one or more individuals among management, other employees, those charged with governance or third parties, involving the use of deception to obtain an unjust or illegal advantage. Although fraud is a broad legal concept, for the purposes of this Instrument, the certifying officers should be concerned with fraud that could cause a material misstatement in the issuer's annual filings, interim filings or other reports filed or submitted under securities legislation. (4) Designing controls, policies and procedures - If the certifying officers choose to use a top-down, risk-based approach, they design specific controls, policies and procedures that, in combination with an issuer's control environment, appropriately address the risks discussed in subsections (2) and (3). If certifying officers choose to use an approach other than a top-down, risk-based approach, they should still consider whether the combination of the components of DC&P and ICFR that they have designed are a sufficient basis for the representations about reasonable assurance required in paragraph 5 of the certificates. Risk Considerations For Designing DC&P and ICFR"}
{"metadata":"12672","text":"(1) Importance of control environment - An issuer's control environment is the foundation upon which all other components of DC&P and ICFR are based and influences the tone of an organization. An effective control environment contributes to the reliability of all other controls, processes and procedures by creating an atmosphere where errors or fraud are either less likely to occur, or if they occur, more likely to be detected. An effective control environment also supports the flow of information within the issuer, thus promoting compliance with an issuer's disclosure policies. An effective control environment alone will not provide reasonable assurance that any of the risks identified will be addressed and managed. An ineffective control environment, however, can undermine an issuer's controls, policies and procedures designed to address specific risks. (2) Elements of a control environment - A key element of an issuer's control environment is the attitude towards controls demonstrated by the board of directors, audit committee and senior management through their direction and actions in the organization. An appropriate tone at the top can help to develop a culture of integrity and accountability at all levels of an organization which support other components of DC&P and ICFR. The tone at the top should be reinforced on an ongoing basis by those accountable for the organization's DC&P and ICFR. In addition to an appropriate tone at the top, certifying officers should consider the following elements of an issuer's control environment: (a) organizational structure of the issuer - a structure which relies on established and documented lines of authority and responsibility may be appropriate for some issuers, whereas a structure which allows employees to communicate informally with each other at all levels may be more appropriate for some issuers; (b) management's philosophy and operating style - a philosophy and style that emphasises managing risks with appropriate diligence and demonstrates receptiveness to negative as well as positive information will foster a stronger control environment; (c) integrity, ethics, and competence of personnel -controls, policies and procedures are more likely to be effective if they are carried out by ethical, competent and adequately supervised employees; (d) external influences that affect the issuer's operations and risk management practices - these could include global business practices, regulatory supervision, insurance coverage and legislative requirements; and (e) human resources policies and procedures - an issuer's hiring, training, supervision, compensation, termination and evaluation practices can affect the quality of the issuer's workforce and its employees' attitudes towards controls. (3) Sources of information about the control environment - The following documentation might provide useful information about an issuer's control environment: (a) written codes of conduct or ethics policies; (b) procedure manuals, operating instructions, job descriptions and training materials; (c) evidence that employees have confirmed their knowledge and understanding of items (a) and (b); (d) organizational charts that identify approval structures and the flow of information; and (e) written correspondence provided by an issuer's external auditor regarding the issuer's control environment. Control Environment"}
{"metadata":"12673","text":"In order for DC&P to provide reasonable assurance that information required by securities legislation to be disclosed by an issuer is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods, DC&P should generally include the following components: (a) written communication to an issuer's employees and directors of the issuer's disclosure obligations, including the purpose of disclosure and DC&P and deadlines for specific filings and other disclosure; (b) assignment of roles, responsibilities and authorizations relating to disclosure; (c) guidance on how authorized individuals should assess and document the materiality of information or events for disclosure purposes; and (d) a policy on how the issuer will receive, document, evaluate and respond to complaints or concerns received from internal or external sources regarding financial reporting or other disclosure issues. An issuer might choose to include these components in a document called a disclosure policy. Part 6 of National Policy 51-201 Disclosure Standards encourages issuers to establish a written disclosure policy and discusses in more detail some of these components.

{"metadata":"12674","text":"In order for ICFR to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with the issuer's GAAP, ICFR should generally include the following components: (a) controls for initiating, authorizing, recording and processing transactions relating to significant accounts and disclosures; (b) controls for initiating, authorizing, recording and processing non-routine transactions and journal entries, including those requiring judgments and estimates; (c) procedures for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies that are in accordance with the issuer's GAAP; (d) controls to prevent and detect fraud; (e) controls on which other controls are dependent, such as information technology general controls; and (f) controls over the period-end financial reporting process, including controls over entering transaction totals in the general ledger, controls over initiating, authorizing, recording and processing journal entries in the general ledger and controls over recording recurring and non-recurring adjustments to the financial statements (e.g., consolidating adjustments and reclassifications). Controls, Policies and Procedures to Include in ICFR Design"}
{"metadata":"12675","text":"(1) Significant accounts and disclosures and their relevant assertions - As described in subsection 6.6(2) of the Policy, a top-down, risk-based approach to designing ICFR involves identifying significant accounts and disclosures and the relevant assertions that affect each significant account and disclosure. This method assists certifying officers in identifying the risks that could reasonably result in a material misstatement in the issuer's financial statements and not all possible risks the issuer faces. (2) Identifying significant accounts and disclosures - A significant account could be an individual line item on the issuer's financial statements, or part of a line item. For example, an issuer might present net revenue, which represents a combination of gross revenue and returns, but might identify gross revenue as a significant account. By identifying part of a line item as a significant account, certifying officers might be able to focus on balances that are subject to specific risks that can be separately identified. A significant disclosure relating to the design of ICFR could be any form of disclosure included in the issuer's financial statements, or notes to the financial statements, that is presented in accordance with the issuer's GAAP. The identification of significant disclosures for the design of ICFR does not extend to the preparation of the issuer's MD&A or other similar financial information presented in a continuous disclosure filing other than financial statements. (3) Considerations for identifying significant accounts and disclosures - A minimum threshold expressed as a percentage or a dollar amount could provide a reasonable starting point for evaluating the significance of an account or disclosure. However, certifying officers should use their judgment, taking into account qualitative factors, to assess accounts or disclosures for significance above or below that threshold. The following factors will be relevant when determining whether an account or disclosure is significant: (a) the size, nature and composition of the account or disclosure; (b) the risk of overstatement or understatement of the account or disclosure; (c) the susceptibility to misstatement due to errors or fraud; (d) the volume of activity, complexity and homogeneity of the individual transactions processed through the account or reflected in the disclosure; (e) the accounting and reporting complexities associated with the account or disclosure; (f) the likelihood (or possibility) of conditions that will give rise to significant contingent liabilities in the account or disclosure; (g) the existence of related party transactions; and (h) the impact of the account on existing debt covenants. (4) Assertions - Using a top-down, risk-based approach, the certifying officers identify those assertions for each significant account and disclosure that presents a risk that could reasonably result in a material misstatement in that significant account or disclosure. For each significant account and disclosure the following assertions could be relevant: (a) existence or occurrence - whether assets or liabilities exist and whether transactions and events that have been recorded have occurred and pertain to the issuer; (b) completeness - whether all assets, liabilities and transactions that should have been recorded have been recorded; (c) valuation or allocation - whether assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses have been included in the financial statements"}
{"metadata":"12675","text":"at appropriate amounts and any resulting valuation or allocation adjustments are appropriately recorded; (d) rights and obligations - whether assets are legally owned by the issuer and liabilities are the obligations of the issuer; and (e) presentation and disclosure - whether particular components of the financial statements are appropriately presented and described and disclosures are clearly expressed. The certifying officers might consider assertions that differ from those listed above if the certifying officers determine that they have identified the pertinent risks in each significant account and disclosure that could reasonably result in a material misstatement. (5) Identifying relevant assertions for each significant account and disclosure - To identify relevant assertions for each significant account and disclosure, the certifying officers determine the source of potential misstatements for each significant account or disclosure. When determining whether a particular assertion is relevant, the certifying officers would consider the nature of the assertion, the volume of transactions or data related to the assertion and the complexity of the underlying systems supporting the assertion. If an assertion does not present a risk that could reasonably result in a material misstatement in a significant account, it is likely not a relevant assertion. For example, valuation might not be relevant to the cash account unless currency translation is involved; however, existence and completeness are always relevant. Similarly, valuation might not be relevant to the gross amount of the accounts receivable balance, but is relevant to the related allowance accounts. (6) Identifying controls, policies and procedures for relevant assertions - Using a top-down, risk- based approach, the certifying officers design components of ICFR to address each relevant assertion. The certifying officers do not need to design all possible components of ICFR to address each relevant assertion, but should identify and design an appropriate combination of controls, policies and procedures to address all relevant assertions. The certifying officers would consider the efficiency of evaluating an issuer's ICFR design when designing an appropriate combination of ICFR components. If more than one potential control, policy or procedure could address a relevant assertion, certifying officers could select the control, policy or procedure that would be easiest to evaluate (e.g., automated control vs. manual control). Similarly, if a control, policy or procedure can be designed to address more than one relevant assertion, then certifying officers could choose it rather than a control, policy or procedure that addresses only one relevant assertion. For example, the certifying officers would consider whether any entity-wide controls exist that adequately address more than one relevant assertion or improve the efficiency of evaluating operating effectiveness because such entity-wide controls negate the need to design and evaluate other components of ICFR at multiple locations or business units. When designing a combination of controls, policies and procedures, the certifying officers should also consider how the components in subsection 6.7(2) of the Policy interact with each other. For example, the certifying officers should consider how information technology general controls interact with controls, policies and procedures over initiating, authorizing, recording, processing and reporting transactions. Identifying Significant Accounts and Disclosures and Their Relevant Assertions"}
{"metadata":"12676","text":"Key features of ICFR and related design challenges are described below. (a) Segregation of duties - The term segregation of duties refers to one or more employees or procedures acting as a check and balance on the activities of another so that no one individual has control over all steps of processing a transaction or other activity. Assigning different people responsibility for authorizing transactions, recording transactions, reconciling information and maintaining custody of assets reduces the opportunity for any one employee to conceal errors or perpetrate fraud in the normal course of his or her duties. Segregating duties also increases the chance of discovering inadvertent errors early. If an issuer has few employees, a single employee may be authorized to initiate, approve and effect payment for transactions and it might be difficult to re-assign responsibilities to segregate those duties appropriately. (b) Board expertise - An effective board objectively reviews management's judgments and is actively engaged in shaping and monitoring the issuer's control environment. An issuer might find it challenging to attract directors with the appropriate financial reporting expertise, objectivity, time, ability and experience. (c) Controls over management override - An issuer might be dominated by a founder or other strong leader who exercises a great deal of discretion and provides personal direction to other employees. Although this type of individual can help an issuer meet its growth and other objectives, such concentration of knowledge and authority could allow the individual an opportunity to override established policies or procedures or otherwise reduce the likelihood of an effective control environment. (d) Qualified personnel - Sufficient accounting and financial reporting expertise is necessary to ensure reliable financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the issuer's GAAP. Some issuers might be unable to obtain qualified accounting personnel or outsourced expert advice on a cost-effective basis. Even if an issuer obtains outsourced expert advice, the issuer might not have the internal expertise to understand or assess the quality of the outsourced advice. If an issuer consults on technically complex accounting matters, this consultation alone is not indicative of a deficiency relating to the design of ICFR. An issuer's external auditor might perform certain services (e.g., income tax, valuation or internal audit services), where permitted by auditor independence rules, that provide skills which would otherwise be addressed by hiring qualified personnel or outsourcing expert advice from a party other than the external auditor. This type of arrangement should not be considered to be a component of the issuer's ICFR design. If an issuer identifies one or more of these ICFR design challenges, additional involvement by the issuer's audit committee or board of directors could be a suitable compensating control or alternatively could mitigate risks that exist as a result of being unable to remediate a material weakness relating to the design challenge. The control framework the certifying officers use to design ICFR could include further information on these design challenges. See section 9.1 of the Policy for a discussion of compensating controls versus mitigating procedures. ICFR Design Challenges"}

{"metadata":"12689","text":"(1) General - Reperformance is the independent execution of certain components of the issuer's DC&P or ICFR that were performed previously. Reperformance could include inspecting records whether internal (e.g., a purchase order prepared by the issuer's purchasing department) or external (e.g., a sales invoice prepared by a vendor), in paper form, electronic form or other media. The reliability of records varies depending on their nature, source and the effectiveness of controls over their production. An example of reperformance is inspecting whether the quantity and price information in a sales invoice agree with the quantity and price information in a purchase order, and confirming that an employee previously performed this procedure. (2) Extent of reperformance - The extent of reperformance of a component of DC&P or ICFR is a matter of judgment for the certifying officers, acting reasonably. Components that are performed more frequently (e.g., controls for recording revenue) will generally require more testing than components that are performed less frequently (e.g., controls for monthly bank reconciliations). Components that are manually operated will likely require more rigorous testing than automated controls. Certifying officers could determine that they do not have to test every individual step comprising a control in order to conclude that the overall control is operating effectively. (3) Reperformance for each evaluation - Certifying officers might find it appropriate to adjust the nature, extent and timing of reperformance for each evaluation. For example, in year 1, certifying officers might test information technology controls extensively, while in year 2, they could focus on monitoring controls that identify changes made to the information technology controls. Certifying officers should consider the specific risks the controls address when making these types of adjustments.

The evidence of operating effectiveness from self-assessment activities depends on the personnel involved and how the activities are conducted. A self-assessment performed by personnel who operate the control would normally be supplemented with direct testing by individuals who are independent from the operation of the control being tested and who have an equal or higher level of authority. In these situations, direct testing of controls would be needed to corroborate evidence from the self-assessment since the self-assessment alone would not have a reasonable level of objectivity. In some situations a certifying officer might perform a self-assessment and the certifying officer is involved in operating the control. Even if no other members of management independent from the operation of the control with equal or higher level of authority can perform direct testing, the certifying officer's self-assessment alone would normally provide sufficient evidence since the certifying officer signs the annual certificate.

Fair Presentation"}
{"metadata":"12714","text":"(1) Access to underlying entity - The nature of an issuer's interest in an underlying entity will affect the certifying officer's ability to design and evaluate the effectiveness of the controls, policies and procedures carried out by the underlying entity. Subsidiary - In the case of an issuer with an interest in a subsidiary, as the issuer controls the subsidiary, certifying officers will have sufficient access to the subsidiary to design and evaluate the effectiveness of the controls, policies and procedures carried out by the underlying entity. Proportionately consolidated entity or SPE - In the case of an issuer with an interest in a proportionately consolidated entity or a SPE, certifying officers might not always have sufficient access to the underlying entity to design and evaluate the effectiveness of the controls, policies and procedures carried out by the underlying entity. Whether the certifying officers have sufficient access to a proportionately consolidated entity or a SPE to design and evaluate the effectiveness of the controls, policies and procedures carried out by the underlying entity is a question of fact. The sufficiency of their access could depend on, among other things: (a) the issuer's percentage ownership of the underlying entity; (b) whether the other underlying entity owners are reporting issuers; (c) the nature of the relationship between the issuer and the operator of the underlying entity if the issuer is not the operator; (d) the terms of the agreement(s) governing the underlying entity; and (e) the date of creation of the underlying entity. Portfolio investment or equity investment - In the case of an issuer with a portfolio investment or an equity investment, certifying officers will generally not have sufficient access to the underlying entity to design and evaluate the effectiveness of the controls, policies and procedures carried out by the underlying entity. (2) Access to an underlying entity in certain indirect offering structures - In the case of certain indirect offering structures, including certain income trust and limited partnership offering structures, the issuer could have: (a) a significant equity interest in the underlying entity but not legally control the underlying entity, since legal control is retained by a third party (typically the party involved in establishing the indirect offering structure) or (b) an equity interest in an underlying entity that represents a significant asset of the issuer and results in the issuer providing the issuer's equity holders with separate audited annual financial statements and interim financial reports prepared in accordance with the same accounting principles as the issuer's financial statements. In these cases, we generally expect the trust indenture, limited partnership agreement or other constating documents to include appropriate terms ensuring the certifying officers will have sufficient access to the underlying entity to design and evaluate the effectiveness of the controls, policies and procedures carried out by the underlying entity. (3) Reasonable steps to design and evaluate - Certifying officers should take all reasonable steps to design and evaluate the effectiveness of the controls, policies and procedures carried out by the underlying entity that provide the certifying officers with a basis for the representations in the annual and interim certificates. However, it is left to the discretion of the certifying officers, acting reasonably, to determine what constitutes reasonable steps. If the certifying officers have access to the underlying entity to design the controls, policies and procedures discussed in subsection (2) and they are not satisfied with those controls, policies and procedures, the certifying officers should consider whether there exists a material weakness or a weakness in DC&P that is significant.

The certifying officers would consider such risks when the certifying officers first identify the risks faced by the issuer in order to determine the scope and necessary complexity of the issuer's DC&P or ICFR, as discussed in subsection 6.6(2) of the Policy.

Meaningful disclosure about an underlying entity that is the subject of a scope limitation would also include any contingent liabilities and commitments for the proportionately consolidated entity or SPE. (5) Limited access to the underlying entity of a portfolio investment or equity investment - Although the certifying officers may not have sufficient access to design and evaluate controls, policies and procedures carried out by the underlying entity of a portfolio investment or equity investment, the issuer's DC&P and ICFR should address the issuer's controls over its disclosure of material information relating to: (a) the carrying amount of the investment; (b) any dividends the issuer receives from the investment; (c) any impairment loss in the investment; and (d) if applicable, the issuer's share of any profit or loss from the equity investment. (6) Reliance on financial information of underlying entity - In most cases, certifying officers will have to rely on the financial information reported by a proportionately consolidated entity, SPE or the underlying entity of an equity investment. In order to certify an issuer's annual or interim filings that include information regarding the issuer's investment in these underlying entities, the certifying officers should perform the following minimum procedures: (a) ensure that the issuer receives the underlying entity's financial information on a timely basis; (b) review the underlying entity's financial information to determine whether it has been prepared in accordance with the issuer's GAAP; and (c) review the underlying entity's accounting policies and evaluate whether they conform to the issuer's accounting policies.

The auditor's specific aims when performing those procedures are to: (a) determine whether the financial statements, and when applicable, the report of the auditor, have been accurately reproduced; and (b) consider whether any of the other information in the document raises questions regarding, or appears to be otherwise inconsistent with, the financial statements.Handbook section 7500 specifies that the auditor should arrange to obtain the md&a prior to its release and perform the procedures set out in the section. Further, when circumstances prevent the auditor from obtaining the md&a prior to its release, the auditor should perform the procedures required by Handbook as soon as possible after its release, and consider advising the audit committee of the circumstances.If the reporting issuer's annual financial statements are audited in accordance with auditing standards other than Canadian GAAS, then the auditor's association with, and the requirement for procedures relating to, annual and interim md&a would be determined by those other auditing standards. re auditor review of MD&A"}

A: Information specifically required by Form 51-102F1 must be included in the md&a, and simply cross-referencing to a note in the financial statements would not be sufficient. For example, although the notes to the financial statements may include information about contractual obligations, Form 51-102F1 requires an issuer that is not a venture issuer to include in the md&a a summary, in tabular form, of contractual obligations. In this example a cross-reference would not meet the Form 51-102F1 requirement.Issuers should use their judgment to ensure the md&a complements and supplements the financial statements.

Coupled with the financial highlights, this information should enable readers to better assess the investment fund's performance and future prospects.Focus the management discussion on material information about the performance of the investment fund, with particular emphasis on known material trends, commitments, events, risks or uncertainties that the manager reasonably expects to have a material effect on the investment fund's future performance or investment activities.The description of the disclosure requirements is intentionally general. This Form contains a minimum number of specific instructions in order to allow, as well as encourage, investment funds to discuss their activities in the most appropriate manner and to tailor their comments to their individual circumstances.

Calculate the monthly average by totalling the values of portfolio securities as at the beginning and end of the first month of the financial year and as at the end of each of the succeeding 11 months and dividing the sum by 13. Exclude from both numerator and denominator amounts relating to all portfolio securities having a remaining term to maturity on the date of acquisition by the investment fund of one year or less. (2) Further to instruction (1), include: (a) proceeds from a short sale in the value of the portfolio securities sold during the period; (b) the cost of covering a short sale in the value of portfolio securities purchased during the period; (c) premiums paid to purchase options in the value of portfolio securities purchased during the period; and (d) premiums received from the sale of options in the value of the portfolio securities sold during the period.

Include a statement of the significance of the assumption that distributions are reinvested for taxable investments.(4) In a general introduction to the Past Performance section, indicate, as applicable, that(a) the performance information shown assumes that all distributions made by the investment fund in the periods shown were reinvested in additional securities of the investment fund;(b) the performance information does not take into account sales, redemption, distribution or other optional charges that would have reduced returns or performance; and(c) how the investment fund has performed in the past does not necessarily indicate how it will perform in the future.(5) Use a linear scale for each axis of the bar chart required by this Item.(6) The x-axis must intersect the y-axis at 0 for the Year-by-Year Returns bar chart.4.2 Year-by-Year Returns (1) Provide a bar chart, under the heading Past Performance and under the sub-heading Year-by-Year Returns, that shows, in chronological order with the most recent year on the right of the bar chart, the annual total return of the investment fund for the lesser of(a) each of the ten most recently completed financial years; and(b) each of the completed financial years in which the investment fund has been in existence and which the investment fund was a reporting issuer.(2) Provide an introduction to the bar chart that(a) indicates that the bar chart shows the investment fund's annual performance for each of the years shown, and illustrates how the investment fund's performance has changed from year to year; and(b) indicates that the bar chart shows, in percentage terms, how much an investment made on the first day of each financial year would have grown or decreased by the last day of each financial year.(3) If the investment fund holds short portfolio positions, show separately the annual total return for both the long portfolio positions and the short portfolio positions in addition to the overall total return.4.3 Annual Compound Returns (1) If the investment fund is not a money market fund, disclose, in the form of a table, under the sub-heading Annual Compound Returns(a) the"}

(2) It may be appropriate for an investment fund that invests in more than one type of security to compare its performance to more than one relevant index. For example, a balanced fund may wish to compare its performance to both a bond index and an equity index. (3) In addition to the appropriate broad-based securities market index, the investment fund may compare its performance to other financial or narrowly-based securities indices (or a blend of indices) that reflect the market sectors in which the investment fund invests or that provide useful comparatives to the performance of the investment fund. For example, an investment fund could compare its performance to an index that measured the performance of certain sectors of the stock market (e.g. communications companies, financial sector companies, etc.) or to a non-securities index, such as the Consumer Price Index, so long as the comparison is not misleading. 4.4 Scholarship Plans An investment fund that is a scholarship plan must comply with this Item, except that year-by-year returns and annual compound returns must be calculated based on the scholarship plan's total portfolio adjusted for cash flows.

As with the other components of the annual MRFP, care should be taken to ensure that the information in the summary of investment portfolio is presented in an easily accessible and understandable way. (2) The Canadian securities regulatory authorities have not prescribed the names of the categories into which the portfolio should be broken down.

Subsection (3) requires the IRC to consider the manager's recommendation, if any, when filling a vacancy or reappointing a member of the IRC.The CSA believe that allowing the IRC to select its own members and decide the term a member can serve will foster independent-minded committees that will be focussed on the best interests of the investment fund. The CSA also consider the members of the IRC to be best-positioned to judge the manner in which a prospective member can contribute to the effectiveness of the IRC.3. The maximum term limit of 6 years specified in subsection (4) for a member to serve on an investment fund's IRC is intended to enhance the independence and effectiveness of the IRC. An IRC may reappoint a member beyond the maximum term, but only with the agreement of the manager. Vacancies and reappointments"}

The Instrument permits the manager to recommend to the members of the IRC the amount and type of compensation to be paid, and requires the IRC to consider that recommendation.2. The CSA expect the IRC and the manager to decide the IRC's compensation in a manner consistent with good governance practices. Among the factors the IRC and manager should consider when determining the appropriate level of compensation are the following:  the number, nature and complexity of the investment funds and the fund families for which the IRC acts; the nature and extent of the workload of each member of the IRC, including the commitment of time and energy that is expected from each member; industry best practices, including industry averages and surveys on IRC compensation; and the best interests of the investment fund.3.

Paragraph (1)(b) gives the IRC the discretion and authority to hire independent legal counsel and other advisers. The CSA expect that the IRC will use independent advisors selectively and only to assist, not replace, IRC decision-making. The CSA do not anticipate that IRCs will routinely use external counsel and other advisers.2.

This section permits an investment fund and the manager to indemnify and purchase insurance coverage for the members of the IRC on terms comparable to those applicable to directors of corporations. The broad goals underlying the indemnity provisions are to allow for reimbursement for reasonable good faith behaviour, thereby discouraging the hindsight application of perfection to the IRC's actions.Under this section, the investment fund is required to indemnify an IRC member who has been sued and has successfully defended the action, subject to certain conditions. If the IRC member does not defend the action successfully, the investment fund and manager may indemnify the member in certain circumstances. The intention of indemnity is to encourage responsible behaviour yet still permit enough leeway to attract strong candidates.The two conditions which must be satisfied in either instance under this section for an IRC member to be indemnified are:The IRC member must have acted in a manner consistent with his or her fiduciary duty with respect to the action or matter for which the IRC member is seeking the indemnification; and the IRC member must have had reasonable grounds for believing that his or her conduct was lawful.The CSA expect any such coverage to be on reasonable commercial terms.3.

Section 4.2 sets out the minimum assessments the independent review committee must perform.

The annual self-assessment by the IRC should improve performance by strengthening each member's understanding of his or her role and fostering better communication and greater cohesiveness among members.3. When evaluating individual performance, it is expected that the IRC consider factors such as the member's attendance and participation in meetings, continuing education activities and industry knowledge.

Section 5.1 recognizes that a manager may not be able to objectively determine whether it is acting in the best interests of the investment fund when it has a conflict of interest. This section requires managers to refer all conflict of interest matters -- not just those subject to prohibitions or restrictions under securities legislation - to the IRC so that an independent perspective can be brought to bear on the manager's proposed action.A decision tree for different types of conflict of interest matters is set out in Appendix A to the Commentary.While the CSA expect the IRC to bring a high degree of rigour and skeptical objectivity to its review of conflict of interest matters, the CSA do not consider it the role of the IRC to second-guess the investment or business decisions of a manager or an entity related to the manager.2. Section 5.1 sets out how the manager must proceed when faced with a conflict of interest matter.Referring proposed actions involving conflict of interest matters to the IRC for its review is not considered by the CSA to detract from the manager's obligations to the investment fund under securities legislation to make decisions in the best interests of the fund.

For the transactions described in subsection (1), provided the manager receives the IRC's approval under this section, and satisfies the additional conditions imposed under the applicable sections of Part 6 of this Instrument or Part 2 and Part 4 of NI 81-102, the manager will be permitted to proceed with the action without obtaining regulatory exemptive relief.The IRC may give its approval for certain actions or categories of actions in the form of a standing instruction as described in section 5.4. If no standing instruction is in effect, the manager is required to seek the IRC's approval prior to proceeding with any action set out in subsection (1). An IRC may consider as guidance any conditions in prior exemptive relief orders, waivers or approvals obtained from the securities regulatory authorities when contemplating the appropriate terms and conditions in its approval.2. If the IRC does not approve a proposed action described in subsection (1), the manager is not permitted to proceed without obtaining exemptive relief from the securities regulatory authorities. The CSA consider it in the best interests of the investment fund, and ultimately investors, for the IRC to be able to stop any proposed action which does not meet the test in subsection (2).3. The CSA would usually expect that, before the IRC approves a proposed action described in subsection (1), it will have requested from the manager or others a report or certification to assist in its determination that the test in subsection (2) has been met.4. The CSA expect that the manager will discuss with the IRC any instance where the IRC does not approve a proposed action, so that an alternative action satisfactory to both the manager and the IRC can be found, if possible.5. The CSA consider that the ability of the manager to seek the removal of a member or members of the IRC under paragraph 3.10(2)(d) sufficiently addresses any concern that a manager may have about an IRC's ongoing refusal to approve matters. Matters requiring independent review committee approval"}
{"metadata":"3027","text":"(1) Before a manager may proceed with a proposed action under section 5.1 other than those set out in subsection 5.2(1),(a) the independent review committee must provide a recommendation to the manager as to whether, in the committee's opinion after reasonable inquiry, the proposed action achieves a fair and reasonable result for the investment fund; and(b) the manager must consider the recommendation of the independent review committee.(2) If the manager decides to proceed with an action in a conflict of interest matter that, in the opinion of the independent review committee after reasonable inquiry, does not achieve a fair and reasonable result for the investment fund under paragraph (1)(a), the manager must notify in writing the independent review committee before proceeding with the proposed action.(3) Upon receiving the notification described in subsection (2), the independent review committee may require the manager to notify securityholders of the investment fund of the manager's decision.(4) A notification to securityholders under subsection (3) must(a) sufficiently describe the proposed action of the manager, the recommendation of the independent review committee and the manager's reasons for proceeding;(b) state the date of the proposed implementation of the action; and(c) be sent by the manager to each securityholder of the investment fund at least thirty days before the effective date of the proposed action.(5) The investment fund must, as soon as practicable, file the notification referred to in subsection (4) with the securities regulatory authority or regulator upon the notice being sent to securityholders.Commentary1. This section captures all conflict of interest matters a manager encounters other than those listed in subsection 5.2(1). This includes conflict of interest matters prohibited or restricted by securities legislation not specified in subsection 5.2(1), and a manager's business and commercial decisions made on behalf of the investment fund that may be motivated, or be perceived to be motivated, by the manager's own interests rather than the best interests of the investment fund. Examples include:  increasing charges to the investment fund for costs incurred by the manager in operating the fund; correcting material errors made by the manager in administering the investment fund; negotiating soft dollar arrangements with dealers with whom the manager places portfolio transactions for the investment fund; and choosing to bring services in-house over using third-party service providers.The CSA expect that, in seeking guidance in identifying conflict of interest matters caught by this Instrument, among the factors the manager will look to for guidance to identify conflict of interest matters will be industry best practices. However, the CSA also acknowledge that each manager will need to consider the nature of its investment fund operations in determining a conflict of interest matter.2. The CSA expect the IRC's recommendation to state a positive or negative response as to whether they view the proposed action as achieving a fair and reasonable result for the investment fund.3. For a proposed action in a conflict of interest matter under this section that is prohibited or restricted by securities legislation (but not specified in subsection 5.2(1)), a manager will still need to seek exemptive relief from the securities regulatory authorities.4. Subsection (2) recognizes that, in exceptional circumstances, the manager may decide to proceed with a proposed course of action despite a negative recommendation from the IRC. In such instances, subsection (2) requires the manager to notify the IRC before proceeding with the action. If the IRC determines that the proposed action is sufficiently important to warrant notice to securityholders in the investment fund, the IRC has the authority to require the manager to give such notification before proceeding with the action.The CSA anticipate that the situation of a manager proceeding with a conflict of interest matter, despite a negative recommendation by the IRC, will occur infrequently.5. The notification referred to in subsection (5) should be filed on the SEDAR group profile number of the investment fund as a continuous disclosure document.

Section 5.4 recognizes that there are certain actions or categories of actions of the manager for which it may be appropriate for the IRC to choose to provide a standing instruction. For example, this may include a manager's ongoing voting of proxies on securities held by the investment fund when the manager has a business relationship with the issuer of the securities, or, a manager's decision to engage in inter-fund trading.2. The CSA expect that, before providing or continuing a standing instruction to the manager for an action or category of actions, the IRC will have:  reviewed the manager's written policies and procedures with respect to the action or category of actions; requested from the manager or other persons a report or certification to assist in deciding whether to give its approval or recommendation for the action or category of actions under subsection 5.2(1) or 5.3(1), as the case may be; considered whether a standing instruction for the particular action or category of actions is appropriate for the investment fund; and established very clear terms and conditions surrounding the standing instruction for the action or category of actions.An IRC may consider including in any standing instruction any terms or conditions in prior exemptive relief orders, waivers or approvals obtained from the securities regulatory authorities.3. As part of the IRC's review under subparagraph (2)(b)(ii), the IRC is expected to be mindful of its reporting obligation under section 4.5 of this Instrument, which includes notifying the securities regulatory authorities of any instance where the manager, in proceeding with an action, did not meet a condition imposed by the IRC in its approval (this includes a standing instruction).4. This section is intended to improve the flexibility and timeliness of the manager's decisions concerning a proposed course of action in a conflict of interest matter. Standing instructions by the independent review committee"}
{"metadata":"3029","text":"(1) Before proceeding with a conflict of interest matter or any other matter that securities legislation requires the manager to refer to the independent review committee, the manager must(a) establish written policies and procedures that it must follow on that matter or on that type of matter, having regard to its duties under securities legislation; and(b) refer the policies and procedures to the independent review committee for its review and input.(2) In establishing the written policies and procedures described in subsection (1), the manager must consider the input of the independent review committee, if any.(3) The manager may revise its policies and procedures if it provides the independent review committee with a written description of any significant changes for the independent review committee's review and input before implementing the revisions.Commentary1. Section 2.2 contemplates that a manager should identify for each investment fund the conflict of interest matters it expects will arise and that will be required to be referred to the IRC under section 5.1, and review its policies and procedures for those matters with the IRC. Section 2.2 further requires the manager to establish policies and procedures for other matters it expects will arise and that will be required by securities legislation to be referred to the IRC, for example, certain reorganizations and transfers of assets between related mutual funds under Part 5 of NI 81-102.2. A manager is expected to establish policies and procedures that are consistent with its obligations to the investment fund under securities legislation to make decisions in the best interests of the fund. Paragraph (1)(a) is intended to reinforce this obligation. A manager that manages more than one investment fund may establish policies and procedures for an action or category of actions for all of the investment funds it manages. Alternatively, the manager may establish separate policies and procedures for the action or category of actions for each of its investment funds, or groups of its investment funds. However structured, the CSA expect the written policies and procedures the manager establishes to be designed to prevent any violations by the manager and the investment fund of securities legislation in the areas that this Instrument addresses, and to detect and promptly correct any violations that occur.3. A manager is expected to follow the policies and procedures established under this section. In referring a matter to the IRC under section 5.1, the CSA expect the manager to inform the IRC whether its proposed action follows its written policies and procedures on the matter. If an unanticipated conflict of interest matter arises for which the manager does not have a policy and procedure, the CSA expect the manager to bring the matter and its proposed action to the IRC for its review and input at the time the matter is referred to the IRC.4. Small investment fund families may require fewer written policies and procedures than large fund complexes that, for example, have conflicts of interest as a result of affiliations with other financial service firms.

The report to be filed with the securities regulatory authorities should be filed on the SEDAR group profile number of the investment fund as a continuous disclosure document. The CSA expect that the investment fund will pay any reasonable costs associated with the filing of the report.2. It is expected the report will be displayed in an easily visible location on the home page of the website of the investment fund, the investment fund family or the manager, as applicable. The CSA expect the report to remain on the website at least until the posting of the next report.3.

The term inter-fund self-dealing investment prohibitions is defined in section 1.5 of this Instrument. It is intended to capture the prohibitions in the securities legislation and certain regulations of each securities regulatory authority regarding inter-fund trades.2. This section is intended to exempt investment funds from the prohibitions in the securities legislation and certain regulations that preclude inter-fund trades. It is not intended to apply to securities issued by an investment fund that are purchased by another fund within the same fund family. The CSA are of the view that this section applies to inter-fund trades between fund families of the same manager provided the purchase or sale is made in accordance with subsection (2).3. This section is also intended to provide a portfolio manager with a dealer registration exemption, where necessary, for inter-fund trades made in accordance with this section, but will not apply to any other activities of the portfolio manager. The exemption is based on compliance with this Instrument and the limitation of its application to prospectus-qualified investment funds. The CSA note that the Registration Reform project may re-examine this exemption.4. This section sets out the minimum conditions for inter-fund trades to proceed without regulatory exemptive relief. An IRC may consider including in any approval any terms or conditions in prior exemptive relief orders, waivers or approvals obtained from the securities regulatory authorities.5. This section does not specify the policies and procedures that a manager must have to effect inter-fund trades. However, the CSA expect the manager's policies to include factors or criteria forallocating securities purchased for or sold by two or more investment funds managed by the manager; andensuring that the terms of purchase or sale will be no less beneficial to the investment fund than those generally available to other market participants in arm's-length transactions.6. The CSA expect that the IRC may give its approval in the form of a standing instruction under section 5.4, to give the manager greater flexibility to take advantage of perceived market opportunity.7. Paragraph (2)(c) requires that the market quotations for the transactions be transparent. The CSA expect that if the price information is publicly available from a marketplace, newspaper or through a data vendor, for example, this will be the price. If the price is not publicly available, the CSA expect the investment fund to obtain at least one quote from an independent, arm's-length purchaser or seller, immediately before the purchase or sale.8. The CSA consider the requirement in paragraph (2)(f) to be a way to facilitate price discovery and integrity. The CSA believe this is essential to well-functioning and efficient capital markets. Subparagraph (1)(b)(iii) is intended to capture, for corporate debt securities, the requirement, if applicable, to report the trade to CanPx, and for illiquid securities, the requirement, if applicable, to report the trade to the Canadian Unlisted Board (CUB).9.

Purpose"}
{"metadata":"2936","text":"(1) The Instrument applies to investment funds. The general nature of an investment fund is that the money invested in it is professionally managed on the basis of a stated investment policy, usually expressed in terms of investment objectives and strategies, and is invested in a portfolio of securities. The fund has the discretion to buy and sell investments within the constraints of its investment policy. Investment decisions are made by a manager or portfolio adviser acting on behalf of the fund. An investment fund provides a means whereby investors can have their money professionally managed rather than making their own decisions about investing in individual securities.(2) An investment fund generally does not seek to obtain control of or become involved in the management of companies in which it invests. Exceptions to this include labour sponsored or venture capital funds, where some degree of involvement in the management of the investees is an integral part of the investment strategy.Investment funds can be distinguished from holding companies, which generally exert a significant degree of control over the companies in which they invest.Â They can also be distinguished from the issuers known as Income Trusts which generally issue securities that entitle the holder to net cash flows generated by (i) an underlying business owned by the trust or other entity, or (ii) the income- producing property owned by the trust or other entity. Examples of entities that are not investment funds are business income trusts, real estate investment trusts and royalty trusts.(3) Investment funds that meet the definition of mutual fund in securities legislation “ generally because their securities are redeemable on demand or within a specified period after demand at net asset value per security “ are referred to as mutual funds. Other investment funds are generally referred to as non-redeemable investment funds. The definition of non-redeemable investment fund included in this instrument summarises the concepts discussed above. Because of their similarity to mutual funds, they are subject to similar reporting requirements. Examples include closed-end funds, funds traded on exchanges with limited redeemability, certain limited partnerships investing in portfolios ofsecurities such as flow-through shares, and scholarship plans (other than self- directed RESPs as defined in OSC Rule 46-501 Self-Directed Registered Education Savings Plans).(4) Labour sponsored and venture capital funds may or may not be considered to be mutual funds depending on the requirements of the provincial legislation under which they are established (for example, shares of Ontario labour sponsored funds are generally redeemable on demand, while shares of British Columbia employee venture capital corporations are not). Nevertheless, these issuers are investment funds and must comply with the general disclosure rules for investment funds as well as specific requirements for labour sponsored and venture capital funds included in Part 8 of this Instrument.

IFRS is defined in National Instrument 14-101 Definitions as the standards and interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board.Subsection 2.6(1) of the Instrument, applicable to financial years beginning before January 1, 2014, refers to Canadian GAAP as applicable to public enterprises, which the CSA considers to be the standards in Part V of the Handbook.(2) The CSA believe that an investment fund™s financial statements must include certain information, at a minimum, in order to provide full disclosure. The Instrument sets out these minimum requirements, but does not mandate all the required disclosure. Canadian GAAP applicable to publicly accountable enterprises also contains minimum requirements relating to the content of financial statements. An investment fund™s financial statements must meet these requirements as well.In some cases, the Instrument prescribes line items that may already be required by Canadian GAAP, but these line items are expressed more specifically for the activities of an investment fund. For example, Canadian GAAP requires a trade and other receivables line item on the statement of financial position, but the Instrument requires accounts receivable to be broken down into more specific categories. In other instances, the line items prescribed in the Instrument are in addition to those in Canadian GAAP.While the Instrument prescribes line items, it does not prescribe the order in which those line items are presented. Investment funds should present line items, as well as any subtotals or totals, in a logical order that will contribute to a reader™s overall understanding of the financial statements.Investment funds are responsible for disclosing all material information concerning their financial position and financial performance in the financial statements.(3) [Repealed].

When soliciting delivery instructions, an investment fund should make clear what the consequence of no response will be to its securityholders.(3) Investment funds should solicit delivery instructions sufficiently ahead of time so that securityholders can receive the requested documents by the relevant filing deadline.

In either case, the manager or portfolio adviser voting proxies on behalf of an investment fund must do so in a manner consistent with the best interests of the fund and its securityholders.(2) Because of the substantial institutional voting power held by investment funds, the increasing importance of the exercise of that power to securityholders, and the potential for conflicts of interest with respect to the exercise of proxy voting, we believe that investment funds should disclose their proxy voting policies and procedures, and should make their actual proxy voting records available to securityholders.(3) The Instrument requires that the investment fund establish policies and procedures for determining whether, and how, to vote on any matter for which the investment fund receives proxy materials for a meeting of securityholders of an issuer.

{"metadata":"2971","text":"(1) A market is generally considered active when quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices reflect actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm™s length basis. Accordingly, fair value should not reflect the amount that would be received or paid in a forced transaction, involuntary liquidation or distress sale.(2) A market is not considered to be active, and prices derived from it may be unreliable for valuation purposes, if, at the time the investment fund begins to calculate its net asset value, any of the following circumstances are present: markets on which portfolio securities are principally traded closed several hours earlier (e.g. some foreign markets may close as much as 15 hours before the time the investment fund begins to calculate its net asset value) trading is halted events occur that unexpectedly close entire markets (e.g. natural disasters, power blackouts, public disturbances, or similar major events) markets are closed due to scheduled holidays Â the security is illiquid and trades infrequently.If an investment fund manager determines that an active market does not exist for a security, the manager should consider whether the last available quoted market price is representative of fair value. If a significant event (i.e. one that may impact the value of the portfolio security) has occurred between the time the last quoted market price was established and the time the investment fund begins to calculate its net asset value, the last quoted market price may not be representative of fair value.(3) Whether a particular event is a significant event for a security depends on whether the event may affect the value of the security. Generally, significant events fall into one of three categories: (i) issuer specific events “ e.g. the resignation of the CEO or an after-hours earnings announcement, (ii) market events “ e.g. a natural disaster, a political event, or a significant governmental action like raising interest rates, and (iii) volatility events “ e.g. a significant movement in North American equity markets that may directly impact the market prices of securities traded on overseas exchanges.Whether a market movement is significant is a matter to be determined by the manager through the establishment of tolerance levels which it may choose to base on, for example, a specified intraday and/or interday percentage movementof a specific index, security or basket of securities.

{"metadata":"2974","text":"(1) Part 15 of the Instrument sets out the method to be used by an investment fund to calculate its management expense ratio (MER). The requirements apply in all circumstances in which an investment fund circulates and discloses an MER. This includes disclosure in a sales communication, a prospectus, a fund facts document, an ETF facts document, an annual information form, financial statements, a management report of fund performance or a report to securityholders.(2) Paragraph 15.1(1)(a) requires the investment fund to use its total expenses (other than distributions if these are an expense for the investment fund) before income taxes for the relevant period as the basis for the calculation of MER. Total expenses, before income taxes, include interest charges and taxes, including sales taxes, GST and capital taxes payable by the investment fund. Withholding taxes need not be included in the MER calculation.The CSA is of the view that if an investment fund issues debt-like securities or securities that otherwise provide leverage to the fund, payments to holders of these securities should be treated as financing costs from the perspective of the investment fund™s other classes of securities (the classes that benefit from the financing or leverage). These costs should not be excluded from total expenses when calculating the MER of the investment fund™s other classes of securities. Securities that provide leverage generally include preferred shares.Non-optional fees paid directly by investors in connection with the holding of an investment fund™s securities do not have to be included in the MER calculation.(3) The CSA recognize that an investment fund may incur fees and charges that are not included in total expenses, but that reduce the net asset value and the amount of investable assets of the investment fund. Sales commissions paid by an investment fund in connection with the sale of the investment fund™s securities are an example of such fees and charges. We believe that these fees and charges should be reflected in the MER of the investment fund.(4) While brokerage commissions and other portfolio transaction costs are expenses of an investment fund for accounting purposes, they are not included in the MER. These costs are reflected in the trading expense ratio.(5) In its management report of fund performance, an investment fund must disclose historical MERs for five years calculated in accordance with Part 15. If the investment fund has not calculated the historical MERs in the manner required by the Instrument, we are of the view that the change in the method of calculating the MER should be treated in a manner similar to a change in accounting policy underInternational Accounting Standard 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. Under Canadian GAAP, a change in accounting policy requires a retrospective application of the change for all periods shown. However, the Handbook acknowledges that there may be circumstances where the data needed to restate the financial information is not reasonably determinable.If an investment fund restates its MER for any of the five years it is required to show, the investment fund should describe this restatement in the first document released and in the first management report of fund performance in which the restated MERs are reported.If an investment fund does not restate its MER for prior periods because, based on specific facts and circumstances, the information required to do so is not reasonably determinable, the MER for all financial periods ending after the effective date of the Instrument must be calculated in accordance with Part 15. In this case, the investment fund must also disclose(i) that the method of calculating MER has changed, specifying for which periods the MER has been calculated in accordance with the change;(ii) that the investment fund has not restated the MER for specified prior periods;(iii) the impact that the change would have had if the investment fund had restated the MER for the specified prior periods (for example, would theMER have increased or decreased and an estimate of the increase or decrease); and(iv) a description of the main differences between an MER calculated in accordance with the Instrument and the previous calculations.The disclosure outlined above should be provided for all periods presented until such time as all MERs presented are calculated in accordance with the Instrument.

Generally, the investment risk level must be determined again whenever it is no longer reasonable in the circumstances.(2) Generally, a change to the mutual fund™s investment risk level disclosed on the most recently filed fund facts document or ETF facts document, as applicable, would be a material change under securities legislation in accordance with Part 11 of National Instrument 81-106 Investment Fund Continuous Disclosure.(3) In deciding whether to exercise the discretion to increase a mutual fund™s investment risk level as permitted in subsection (2) above, consideration should be given as to whether the standard deviation calculation applied under the Investment Risk Classification Methodology may result in a risk level that is below the manager™s own expectations for the mutual fund. This can occur, for example, when a mutual fund employs investment strategies that produce an atypical or nonnormal distribution of performance results. In such circumstances mutual funds are encouraged to consider supplementing the Investment Risk Classification Methodology with other factors or risk metrics in order to determine whether it would be appropriate to make an upward adjustment of the mutual fund™s risk level to better reflect the features of the mutual fund. Item 1 - Investment risk level"}

Item 2 - Standard deviation"}

However, a particular series or class of securities of a mutual fund may have a different investment risk level than the other series or classes of securities of the same mutual fund if that series or class of securities has an attribute that differs from the others. For example, a series or class of securities that employs currency hedging or that is offered in the currency of the United States of America (if the mutual fund is otherwise offered in the currency of Canada) has an attribute that could result in a different investment risk level than that of the mutual fund.

Likewise, if a mutual fund that is structured as a corporate class fund does not have 10 years of performance history, the past performance of a mutual fund trust version of that mutual fund should be used to fill in the missing past performance information required to calculate standard deviation.

The definition of fundamental investment objectives contained in the Instrument uses the language contained in the disclosure requirements of Form 81-101F1 and Form 41-101F2, and the definition should be read to include the matters that would have to be disclosed under the Item of the applicable form concerning Fundamental Investment Objectives. Accordingly, any change to the investment fund requiring a change to that disclosure would trigger the requirement for securityholder approval under paragraph 5.1(1)(c) of the Instrument.(2) Form 41-101F2 and Part B of Form 81-101F1 set out, among other things, the obligation that an investment fund disclose in a prospectus both its fundamental investment objectives and its investment strategies. The matters required to be disclosed under the Item of the applicable form relating to Investment Strategies are not fundamental investment objectives under the Instrument.(3) Generally speaking, the fundamental investment objectives of an investment fund are those attributes that define its fundamental nature. For example, investment funds that are guaranteed or insured, or that pursue a highly specific investment approach such as index funds or derivative funds, may be defined by those attributes. Often the manner in which an investment fund is marketed will provide evidence as to its fundamental nature; an investment fund whose advertisements emphasize, for instance, that investments are guaranteed likely will have the existence of a guarantee as a fundamental investment objective.(4) [Deleted](5) One component of the definition of fundamental investment objectives is that those objectives distinguish an investment fund from other investment funds.

The Canadian securities regulatory authorities are of the view that there need not be complete congruence between the hedging instrument or instruments and the position or positions being hedged if it is reasonable to regard the one as a hedging instrument for the other, taking into account the closeness of the relationship between fluctuations in the price of the two and the availability and pricing of hedging instruments.(2) The definition of hedging includes a reference to the maintaining of the position resulting from a hedging transaction or series of hedging transactions. The inclusion of this component in the definition requires an investment fund to ensure that a transaction continues to offset specific risks of the investment fund in order that the transaction be considered a hedging transaction under the Instrument; if the hedging position ceases to provide an offset to an existing risk of an investment fund, then that position is no longer a hedging position under the Instrument, and can be held by the investment fund only in compliance with the specified derivatives rules of the Instrument that apply to non-hedging positions. The component of the definition that requires the maintaining of a hedge position does not mean that an investment fund is locked into a specified derivatives position; it simply means that the specified derivatives position must continue to satisfy the definition of hedging in order to receive hedging treatment under the Instrument.(3) Paragraph (b) of the definition of hedging has been included to ensure that currency cross hedging continues to be permitted under the Instrument. Currency cross hedging is the substitution of currency risk associated with one currency for currency risk associated with another currency, if neither currency is a currency in which the investment fund determines its net asset value per security and the aggregate amount of currency risk to which the investment fund is exposed is not increased by the substitution. Currency cross hedging is to be distinguished from currency hedging, as that term is ordinarily used. Ordinary currency hedging, in the context of investment funds, would involve replacing the investment fund™s exposure to a non-net asset value currency with exposure to a currency in which the investment fund calculates its net asset value per security.

Appropriate internal limits for the investment fund™s liquidity needs, in line with its investment strategies, should be established.(2) As portfolio assets may become illiquid when market conditions change, the Canadian securities regulatory authorities are of the view that the manager should regularly measure, monitor and manage the liquidity of the investment fund™s portfolio assets, keeping in mind the time to liquidate each portfolio asset, the price the asset may be sold at and the pattern of redemption requests.(3) Furthermore, the Canadian securities regulatory authorities are of the view that illiquid assets are generally more difficult to value, for the purposes of calculating an investment fund™s net asset value, than assets which are liquid. As a result, where a non-redeemable investment fund has a large proportion of its assets invested in illiquid assets, this raises concerns about the accuracy of the fund™s net asset value and the amount of any fees calculated with reference to net asset value. Accordingly, staff of the Canadian securities regulatory authorities may raise comments or questions in the course of their reviews of the prospectuses or continuous disclosure documents of non-redeemable investment funds where such funds have a significant proportion of their assets invested in illiquid assets.

It is expected that, in addition to satisfying these conditions, the manager on behalf of the investment fund, in co-ordination with an agent, will ensure that the documentation evidencing these types of transactions contains customary provisions to protect the investment fund and to document the transaction properly. Among other things, these provisions would normally include(a) a definition of an event of default under the agreement, which would include failure to deliver cash or securities, or to promptly pay to the investment fund amounts equal to dividends and interest paid, and distributions made, on loaned or sold securities, as required by the agreement(b) provisions giving non-defaulting parties rights of termination, rights to sell the collateral, rights to purchase identical securities to replace the loaned securities and legal rights of set-off in connection with their obligations if an event of default occurs and(c) provisions that deal with, if an event of default occurs, how the value of collateral or securities held by the non-defaulting party that is in excess of the amount owed by the defaulting party will be treated.(2) Section 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14 of the instrument each imposes a requirement that an investment fund that has entered into a securities lending, repurchase or reverse repurchase transaction hold cash or securities of at least 102% of the market value of the securities or cash held by the investment fund™s counterparty under the transaction. It is noted that the 102% requirement is a minimum requirement, and that it may be appropriate for the manager of an investment fund, or the agent acting on behalf of the investment fund, to negotiate the holding of a greater amount of cash or securities if necessary to protect the interests of the investment fund in a particular transaction, having regard to the level of risk for the investment fund in the transaction. In addition, if the recognized best practices for a particular type of transaction in a particular market calls for a higher level of collateralization than 102%, it is expected that, absent special circumstances, the manager or the agent would ensure that its arrangements reflect the relevant best practices for that transaction.(3) Paragraph 3 of subsection 2.12(1) of the Instrument refers to securities lending transactions in terms of securities that are loaned by an investment fund in exchange for collateral. Some securities lending transactions are documented so that title to the loaned securities is transferred from the lender to the borrower. The Canadian securities regulatory authorities do not consider this fact as sufficient to disqualify those transactions as securities loan transactions within the meaning of the Instrument, so long as the transaction is in fact substantively a loan. References throughout the Instrument to loaned securities, and similar references, should be read to include securities transferred under a securities lending transaction.(4) Subparagraph 6(d) of subsection 2.12(1) permits the use of irrevocable letters of credit as collateral in securities lending transactions. The Canadian securities regulatory authorities believe that, at a minimum, the prudent use of letters of credit will involve the following arrangements:(a) the investment fund should be allowed to draw down any amount of the letter of credit at any time by presenting its sight draft and certifying that the borrower is in default of its obligations under the securities lending agreement, and the amount capable of being drawn down would represent the current market value of the outstanding loaned securities or the amount required to cure any other borrower default; and(b) the letter of credit should be structured so that the lender may draw down, on the date immediately preceding its expiration date, an amount equal to the current market value of all outstanding loaned securities on that date.(5) Paragraph 9 of subsection 2.12(1) and paragraph 8 of subsection 2.13(1) of the Instrument each provides that the agreement under which an investment fund enters into a securities lending or repurchase transaction include a provision requiring the investment fund™s counterparty to promptly pay to the investment fund, among other things, distributions made on the securities loaned or sold in the transaction. In this context, the term distributions should be read broadly to include all payments or distributions of any type made on the underlying securities, including, without limitation, distributions of(6) Sections 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14 of the Instrument each make reference to the delivery and holding of securities or collateral by the investment fund. The Canadian securities regulatory authorities note that these terms will include the delivery or holding by an agent for an investment fund. In addition, the Canadian securities regulatory authorities recognize that under ordinary market practice, agents pool collateral for securities lending/repurchase clients; this pooling of itself is not considered a violation of the Instrument.(7) Sections 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14 of the Instrument each require that the securities involved in a securities lending, repurchase or reverse repurchase transaction be marked to market daily and adjusted as required daily.

The valuation principles used in this marking to market may be those generally used by the agent acting for the investment fund, even if those principles deviate from the principles that are used by the investment fund in valuing its portfolio assets for the purposes of calculating net asset value.(9) Paragraph 6 of subsection 2.13(1) of the Instrument imposes a requirement concerning the delivery of sales proceeds to the investment fund equal to 102% of the market value of the securities sold in the transaction. It is noted that accrued interest on the sold securities should be included in the calculation of the market value of those securities.(10) Section 2.15 of the Instrument imposes the obligation on a manager of an investment fund to appoint an agent or agents to administer its securities lending and repurchase transactions, and makes optional the ability of a manager to appoint an agent or agents to administer its reverse repurchase transactions. A manager that appoints more than one agent to carry out these functions may allocate responsibility as it considers best. For instance, it may be appropriate that one agent be responsible for domestic transactions, with one or more agents responsible for offshore transactions. Managers should ensure that the various requirements of sections 2.15 and 2.16 of the Instrument are satisfied for all agents.(11) It is noted that the responsibilities of an agent appointed under section 2.15 of the Instrument include all aspects of acting on behalf of an investment fund in connection with securities lending, repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements. This includes acting in connection with the reinvestment of collateral or securities held during the life of a transaction.(12) Subsection 2.15(3) of the Instrument requires that an agent appointed by an investment fund to administer its securities lending, repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions shall be a custodian or sub-custodian of the investment fund. It is noted that the provisions of Part 6 of the Instrument generally apply to the agent in connection with its activities relating to securities lending, repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions. The agent must have been appointed as custodian or sub- custodian in accordance with section 6.1, and must satisfy the other requirements of Part 6 in carrying out its responsibilities.(13) Subsection 2.15(4) of the Instrument provides that the manager of an investment fund must not authorize an agent to enter into securities lending, repurchase or, if applicable, reverse repurchase transactions on behalf of the investment fund unless there is a written agreement between the agent, the manager and the investment fund that deals with certain prescribed matters. Subsection (4) requires that the manager and the investment fund, in the agreement, provide instructions to the agent on the parameters to be followed in entering into the type of transaction to which the agreement pertains. The parameters would normally include(a) details on the types of transactions that may be entered into by the investment fund;(b) types of portfolio assets of the investment fund to be used in the transaction;(c) specification of maximum transaction size, or aggregate amount of assets that may be committed to transactions at any one time;(d) specification of permitted counterparties;(e) any specific requirements regarding collateralization, including minimum requirements as to amount and diversification of collateralization, and details on the nature of the collateral that may be accepted by the investment fund;(f) directions and an outline of responsibilities for the reinvestment of cash collateral received by the investment fund under the program to ensure that proper levels of liquidity are maintained at all times; and(g) duties and obligations on the agent to take action to obtain payment by a borrower of any amounts owed by the borrower.(14) The definition of cash cover contained in section 1.1 of the Instrument requires that the portfolio assets used for cash cover not be allocated for specific purposes. Securities loaned by a mutual fund in a securities lending transaction have been allocated for specific purposes and therefore cannot be used as cash cover by the mutual fund for its specified derivatives obligations.(15) An investment fund sometimes needs to vote securities held by it in order to protect its interests in connection with corporate transactions or developments relating to the issuers of the securities. The manager and the portfolio adviser of an investment fund, or the agent of the investment fund administering a securities lending program on behalf of the investment fund, should monitor corporate developments relating to securities that are loaned by the investment fund in securities lending transactions, and take all necessary(16) As part of the prudent management of a securities lending, repurchase or reverse repurchase program, managers of investment funds, together with their agents, should ensure that transfers of securities in connection with those programs are effected in a secure manner over an organized market or settlement system.

Specifically, money market funds must keep 5% of their assets invested in cash or readily convertible into cash within one day, and 15% of their assets invested in cash or readily convertible into cash within one week. Assets that are readily convertible to cash would generally be short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Such assets can be sold in the ordinary course of business within one business day (in the case of the daily liquidity requirement) or within five business days (in the case of the weekly liquidity requirement) at approximately the value ascribed to them by the money market fund. The Canadian securities regulatory authorities note that the securities do not have to mature within the one and five business day periods.

The Canadian securities regulatory authorities consider that, to satisfy this requirement, the issue price of the securities should generally not be a price that is less than the net asset value per security of that class, or series of a class, determined on the date of issuance. However, the Canadian securities regulatory authorities recognize that the determination of what is reasonably practicable is fact-specific and will vary depending on the type of offering or issuance.(2) For example, the Canadian securities regulatory authorities generally expect that any issuances of new securities of a non-redeemable investment fund in connection with a merger of the fund, or any issuances of new securities to the manager of the non- redeemable investment fund as payment of management fees, be issued at a price that is not less than the NAV per security on the date of issuance. However, the Canadian securities regulatory authorities have observed when an existing non-redeemable investment fund issues new securities under a prospectus, the issue price typically exceeds the net asset value per security on the day before the date of the prospectus, such that the net proceeds of the offering on a per unit basis is no less than the net asset value per security on the day before the date of the prospectus.

Those principal distributors and participating dealers are prohibited from commingling any cash so received with their other assets or with cash held for the purchase or upon the sale of securities of other types of securities. The Canadian securities regulatory authorities are of the view that this means that dealers may not deposit into the trust accounts established under Part 11 cash obtained from the purchase or sale of other types of securities such as guaranteed investment certificates, government treasury bills, segregated funds or bonds.(2) Subsection s 11.1(2) and 11.2(2) of the Instrument state that principal distributors and participating dealers, respectively, may not use any cash received for the investment in investment fund securities to finance their own operations. The Canadian securities regulatory authorities are of the view that any costs associated with returned client cheques that did not have sufficient funds to cover a trade (NSF cheques) are a cost of doing business and should be borne by the applicable principal distributor or participating dealer and should not be offset by interest income earned on the trust accounts established under Part 11 of the Instrument.(3) No overdraft positions should arise in these trust accounts.(4) Subsections 11.1(3) and 11.2(3) of the instrument prescribe the circumstances under which a principal distributor or participating dealer, respectively, may withdraw funds from the trust accounts established under Part 11 of the instrument. This would prevent the practice of lapping. Lapping occurs as a result of the timing differences between trade date and settlement date, when cash of an investment fund client held for a trade which has not yet settled is used to settle a trade for another investment fund client who has not provided adequate cash to cover the settlement of that other trade on the settlement date. The Canadian securities regulatory authorities view this practice as a violation of sections 11.1(3) and 11.2(3) of the instrument.(5)Subsection s 11.1(4) and 11.2(4) of the Instrument require that interest earned on cash held in the trust accounts established under Part 11 of the Instrument be paid to the applicable investment fund or its securityholders pro rata based on cash flow. The Canadian securities regulatory authorities are of the view that this requirement means, in effect, that the applicable investment fund or securityholder should be paid the amount of interest that the investment fund or securityholder would have received had the cash held in trust for that investment fund or securityholder been the only cash held in that trust account.(6) Paragraph 11.3(b) of the Instrument requires that trust accounts maintained in accordance with sections 11.1 or 11.2 of the Instrument bear interest at rates equivalent to comparable accounts of the financial institution.

Whether a particular description, representation, illustration or other statement in a sales communication is misleading depends upon an evaluation of the context in which it is made. The following list sets out some of the circumstances, in the view of the Canadian securities regulatory authorities, in which a sales communication would be misleading. No attempt has been made to enumerate all such circumstances since each sales communication must be assessed individually.1. A statement would be misleading if it lacks explanations, qualifications, limitations or other statements necessary or appropriate to make the statement not misleading.2. A representation about past or future investment performance would be misleading if it is(a) a portrayal of past income, gain or growth of assets that conveys an impression of the net investment results achieved by an actual or hypothetical investment that is not justified under the circumstances;(b) a representation about security of capital or expenses associated with an investment that is not justified under the circumstances or a representation about possible future gains or income; or(c) a representation or presentation of past investment performance that implies that future gains or income may be inferred from or predicted based on past investment performance or portrayals of past performance.3. A statement about the characteristics or attributes of an investment fund or an asset allocation service would be misleading if(a) it concerns possible benefits connected with or resulting from services to be provided or methods of operation and does not give equal prominence to discussion of any risks or associated limitations;(b) it makes exaggerated or unsubstantiated claims about management skill or techniques; characteristics of the investment fund or asset allocation service; an investment in securities issued by the fund or recommended by the service; services offered by the fund, the service or their respective manager; or effects of government supervision; or(c) it makes unwarranted or incompletely explained comparisons to other investment vehicles or indices.4. A sales communication that quoted a third party source would be misleading if the quote were out of context and proper attribution of the source were not given.(2) Performance data information may be misleading even if it complies technically with the requirements of the Instrument. For instance, subsections 15.8(1) and (2) of the Instrument contain requirements that the standard performance data for investment funds given in sales communications be for prescribed periods falling within prescribed amounts of time before the date of the appearance or use of the advertisement or first date of publication of any other sales communication."}

The Canadian securities regulatory authorities are of the view that a sales communication that provides performance data in compliance with the requirements of Part 15 of the Instrument for time periods that differ from those shown in a prospectus, fund facts document or management report of fund performance does not violate the requirements of paragraph 15.2(1)(b) of the Instrument.(6) Subsection 15.3(1) of the Instrument permits an investment fund or asset allocation service to compare its performance to, among other things, other types of investments or benchmarks on certain conditions. Examples of such other types of investments or benchmarks to which the performance of an investment fund or asset allocation service may be compared include consumer price indices; stock, bond or other types of indices; averages; returns payable on guaranteed investment certificates or other certificates of deposit; and returns from an investment in real estate.(7) Paragraph 15.3(1)(c) of the Instrument requires that, if the performance of an investment fund or asset allocation service is compared to that of another investment or benchmark, the comparison sets out clearly any factors necessary to ensure that the comparison is fair and not misleading.

Examples of such differences include any relevant differences in the guarantees of, or insurance on, the principal of or return from theinvestment or benchmark; fluctuations in principal, income or total return; any differing tax treatment; and, for a comparison to an index or average, any differences between the composition or calculation of the index or average and the investment portfolio of the investment fund or asset allocation service.

Examples of these changes are changes in the management, investment objectives, portfolio adviser, ownership of the manager, fees and charges, or of policies concerning the waiving or absorbing of fees and charges, of the investment fund or asset allocation service or of a change in the characterization of a mutual fund as a money market fund. A reorganization or restructuring of an investment fund that results in a conversion of a non-redeemable investment fund into a mutual fund, or the conversion of a mutual fund into a non-redeemable investment fund, would also be an example of such a change.(1.1) Subparagraph 15.6(1)(d)(i) of the Instrument prohibits a sales communication pertaining to a mutual fund from including performance data for a period that is before the time when the mutual fund offered its securities under a prospectus. Where the mutual fund has previously existed as a non-redeemable investment fund and has been a reporting issuer in a jurisdiction for a period of at least 12 consecutive months, either as a mutual fund or a non-redeemable investment fund, subsection 15.6(2) requires any sales communication that contains performance data of the mutual fund to include performance data for the period that the fund existed as a non-redeemable investment fund. The Canadian securities regulatory authorities are of the view that performance data pertaining to a mutual fund that has converted from a non-redeemable investment fund should include both the periods before and after the converting transaction, similar to the past performance information presented in the mutual fund™s management report of fund performance. Performance data must not be included for any period before the time the non-redeemable investment fund was a reporting issuer.(2) Paragraph 15.11(1)5 of the instrument requires that no non-recurring fees and charges that are payable by some or all securityholders and no recurring fees and charges that are payable by some but not all securityholders be assumed in calculating standard performance data. Examples of non-recurring types of fees and charges are front-end sales commissions and contingent deferred sales charges, and examples of recurring types of fees and charges are the annual fees paid by purchasers who purchased on a contingent deferred charge basis.(3) Paragraphs 15.11(1)2 and 15.11(2)2 of the instrument require that"}

The Canadian securities regulatory authorities are of the view that such pro forma information is hypothetical, involving the making of many assumptions that could affect the results.(5)Subsections 15.8(2) and (3) of the Instrument require disclosure of standard performance data of a mutual fund, in some circumstances, from the inception of the mutual fund. It is noted that paragraph 15.6(1)(d) generally prohibits disclosure of performance data for a period that is before the time when the mutual fund offered its securities under a prospectus or before an asset allocation service commenced operation. Also, each of Instruction (1) to Item 5 of Part B of Form 81-101F1 Contents of Simplified Prospectus and Instruction (1) to Item 2 of Part I of Form 81-101F3 Contents of Fund Facts Document requires disclosure of the date on which a mutual fund's securities first became available to the public as the date on which the mutual fund started. Therefore, consistent with these provisions, the words inception of the mutual fund in subsections 15.8(2) and (3) of the instrument should be read as referring to the beginning of the distribution of the securities of the mutual fund under a prospectus of the mutual fund, and not from any previous time in which the mutual fund may have existed but did not offer its securities under a prospectus. If a mutual fund previously existed as a non- redeemable investment fund, the words inception of the mutual fund in subsections 15.8(2) and (3) of the Instrument should be read as referring to the date that the non- redeemable investment fund became a reporting issuer.(6) Paragraph 15.6(1)(a) of the Instrument contains a prohibition against the inclusion of performance data for a mutual fund that has been distributing securities for less than 12 consecutive months. The creation of a new class or series of security of an existing mutual fund does not constitute the creation of a new mutual fund and therefore does not subject the mutual fund to the restrictions of paragraph 15.6(1)(a) unless the new class or series is referable to a new portfolio of assets.(7) section15.14of the instrument contains the rules relating to sales communications for multi-class investment funds.

{"metadata":"2785","text":"Date: August 23, 2018PurposeThe purpose of this notice is to set out the views of the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) staff regarding the implementation of the Canadian bail-in regime and to provide clarity on certain issues for investment fund issuers subject to National Instrument 81-102 Investment Funds (NI 81-102).BackgroundOn June 22, 2016, federal amendments to the Bank Act and the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act that implement a bail-in regime for Canada's domestic systemically importantbanks (D-SIBs) received Royal Assent. [FN1] The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) has declared the six largest domestic Canadian banks [FN2] as D-SIBs. In 2013, the AutoritÃ© des marchÃ©s financiers (AMF) designated the Desjardins Group as a domestic systemically important financial institution. On July 13, 2018, amendments to the Deposit Insurance Act (QuÃ©bec) came into force, which established a bail-in regime that applies to the Desjardins Group. Subject to the upcoming adoption of implementing regulations, the Desjardins Group will be subject to a bail-in regime that is similar to the one applicable to D-SIBs.If OSFI is of the opinion that a D-SIB has ceased, or is about to cease, to be viable, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) may, in certain circumstances, take temporary control orownership of the D-SIB and convert all or a portion of the D-SIB™s bail-in debt (Bail-in Debt) into common shares of the D-SIB. The term Bail-in Debt refers to certain debt issued byD-SIBs before any conversion occurs under the Canadian bail-in regime.The details of Bail-in Debt are set out in regulations under the Bank Act and the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act that were adopted by the federal government on March 26, 2018, andwill come into force on September 23, 2018 (Regulations). [FN3] Under the Regulations, Bail-in Debt generally includes all unsubordinated unsecured debt of a D-SIB that is tradeable andtransferable with an original term to maturity of over 400 days. Explicit exclusions from the bail-in regime are provided for covered bonds, derivatives and certain structured notes. [FN4]The Regulations also include certain disclosure and naming requirements in respect of Bail-in Debt.CSA staff guidanceCSA staff notes that pursuant to subsection 2.18(1) of NI 81-102, a money market fund is restricted in the types of securities it may have in its portfolio. In general, a money market fund may invest in investment grade short-term debt (i.e. remaining term to maturity of 365 days or less) to achieve its investment objectives of capital preservation and liquidity. CSA staff have received inquiries as to whether Bail-in Debt could be an eligible investment for a money market fund.Given that Bail-in Debt is different from conventional convertible debt and is convertible in certain circumstances as defined in the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act, CSA staff™s view is that money market funds are permitted to invest in Bail-in Debt so long as the Bail-in Debt continues to meet the prescribed eligibility requirements applicable to money market funds [FN5] as set out in NI 81-102. For example, investment fund managers (IFMs) must continually monitor their investments in Bail-in Debt to ensure that such investments are in compliance with the designated rating requirements as prescribed by NI 81-102 and are generally readily convertible to cash, among other requirements, to ensure the safety and liquidity in such a money market"}

{"metadata":"2787","text":"Date: May 14, 2010PurposeThis notice sets out the views of staff of the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC Staff) on circumstances that may cause OSC Staff to view a proposed transaction or relevant series of transactions for which regulatory approval in respect of a mutual fund has been sought under Part 5 of National Instrument 81-102 Mutual Funds (NI 81-102) as requiring securityholder approval.Change in Control of a Manager vs. Change of ManagerA change in control of the manager of a mutual fund requires the prior approval by the securities regulatory authorities under subsection 5.5(2) of NI 81-102. A change in the manager of a mutual fund requires prior approval by the securities regulatory authorities under paragraph 5.5(1)(a) of NI 81-102 and, unless the new manager is an affiliate of the current manager, prior securityholder approval pursuant to paragraph 5.1(b) of NI 81-102.OSC Staff have seen an increasing number of applications for approval of a change in control of the manager of a mutual fund that, upon further examination of the substance of the proposed transaction or relevant series of transactions and its impact on the securityholders of the mutual fund, appear to OSC Staff to make it appropriate for approval by the securities regulatory authorities to be provided on the basis that there is a change in the manager of the mutual fund requiring securityholder approval.In our review of applications for regulatory approval for a change in control of the manager of the mutual fund, OSC Staff will consider the intended final outcome for the securityholders of the mutual fund. We may ask the applicant for submissions in order to ascertain whether the result for securityholders of the proposed transaction or relevant series of transactions is effectively a change of the manager, rather than a change in control of the manager. When examining the substance of a proposed transaction or relevant series of transactions, OSC Staff will raise questions where it appears the transaction or series of transactions has been structured to effect a change of manager of the mutual fund without securityholder approval.Generally, this issue will arise if a proposed transaction or relevant series of transactions is structured in one of the following ways:(i) the manager of a mutual fund amalgamates with another investment fund manager; or (ii) if, immediately following a change in control of the manager of the mutual fund, a change of manager will occur where the new manager will be the entity that acquired control of the original manager or an affiliate of such entity; or(iii) when it is contemplated that within a foreseeable period of time following a change in control of the manager of the mutual fund, a change of manager of the mutual fund will occur where the new manager will be the entity that acquired control of the original manager or an affiliate of such entity.Further InformationIssuers and their counsel are encouraged to contact OSC Staff at an early stage in the planning of any transaction that may giverise to any questions concerning the issue discussed in this Notice.QuestionsIf you have any questions, please refer them to:Rhonda GoldbergDeputy Director, Investment Funds BranchOntario Securities CommissionTel: (416) 593“3682Email: rgoldberg@osc.gov.on.caIrene LeeLegal Counsel, Investment Funds BranchOntario Securities CommissionTel: (416) 593-3668Email: ilee@osc.gov.on.caCarina KwanLegal Counsel, Investment Funds BranchOntario Securities CommissionTel: (416) 593“8052Email: ckwan@osc.gov.on.ca OSC Staff Notice 81-710 Approvals for Change in Control of a Mutual Fund Manager and Change of a Mutual Fund Manager under National Instrument 81-102 Mutual Funds"}

{"metadata":"11606","text":"Common terms used to identify non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted earnings, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, pro forma earnings, cash earnings, distributable cash, adjusted funds from operations, earnings before non-recurring items and measures presented on a constant-currency basis. Many of these terms lack standard meanings. Issuers across a spectrum of industries, and within the same industry, may use the same term to refer to different compositions. The following are examples of measures that are not captured by the definition: Amounts that do not depict historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flow, which relate to elements of the primary financial statements as defined in the Instrument, such as share price, market capitalization, or credit rating; Financial information that does not have the effect of providing a financial measure that is different from a financial measure presented in the primary financial statements, such as the addition or subtraction of an identical line item, or a subtotal or total originating from multiple periods of primary financial statements. For example, rolling 12-month results or fourth quarter revenue calculated by subtracting year-to-date third quarter revenue from the annual revenue presented in primary financial statements; or A financial measure which does not exclude an amount that is included in, or include an amount that is excluded from, the composition of the most directly comparable financial measure presented in the primary financial statements of the entity. For example, assets under management representing the total market value of invested assets managed by the issuer which are beneficially owned by clients and not reported in the primary financial statements of the issuer. Component Information When an issuer presents a financial statement line item in a more granular way outside the financial statements, otherwise known as a disaggregation, that number is a component of a line item that has been calculated in accordance with the accounting policies used to prepare the line item presented in the financial statements. Such a financial measure would not be a non-GAAP financial measure because it is not a financial measure which excludes an amount that is included in, or includes an amount that is excluded from, the composition of the most directly comparable financial measure presented in the primary financial statements of the entity. However, even though such a measure would not be a non-GAAP financial measure, it may still meet the definition of a supplementary financial measure. For example, an issuer may disclose sales per square foot on a periodic basis to depict its financial performance. When the sales figure, included in sales per square foot, is extracted directly from the primary financial statements or is a component"}
{"metadata":"11606","text":"of such line item (when the component is calculated in accordance with the issuer's accounting policies used to prepare the line item presented in the financial statements), the sales per square foot measure would not meet the definition of a non-GAAP ratio but would meet the definition of a supplementary financial measure. However, if the sales figure is not calculated in accordance with the issuer's accounting policies, the sales per square foot measure in this example would meet the definition of a non-GAAP ratio. Combinations of Line Items A financial measure calculated by combining financial information that originates from different line items from the primary financial statements would meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure if the measure depicts financial performance, financial position or cash flow, unless that resulting measure is separately disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures that are Forward-looking Information Forward-looking information for which there is an equivalent historical financial measure disclosed in the financial statements does not meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Therefore, section 7 of the Instrument does not apply to measures such as future capital management measures and future total of segments measures. In addition, if, for example, revenue is disclosed on a forward-looking basis using the accounting policies applied by the issuer in its latest set of financial statements (i.e., revenue as presented in the primary financial statements adjusted only for assumptions about future economic conditions and courses of action), this forward-looking revenue is not a non-GAAP financial measure. Conversely, if an issuer discloses EBITDA on a forward-looking basis and does not disclose this financial measure in the financial statements, this forward-looking EBITDA does meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure that is forward-looking information. Issuers are reminded that forward-looking information is subject to the disclosure requirements in Parts 4A and 4B and section 5.8 of National Instrument 51-102 Continuous Disclosure Obligations (NI 51-102). Non-Financial Information For clarity, the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure does not include non-financial information such as the following: Number of units; Number of subscribers; Volumetric information; Number of employees or workforce by type of contract or geographical location; Environmental measures such as greenhouse gas emissions; Information on major shareholdings; Acquisition or disposal of the issuer's own shares; and Total number of voting rights. The above list is not exhaustive.

{"metadata":"11608","text":"Component Information An issuer that operates in the retail industry may disclose financial results for same-store sales each reporting period. When same-store sales, a component of overall sales, is calculated in accordance with the accounting policies used to prepare the sales line item presented in the primary financial statements, it would not meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. However, since in this example same-store sales is used by the issuer to depict financial performance by reporting sales performance from period to period, it would meet the definition of a supplementary financial measure. Conversely, when the measure is not calculated in accordance with the issuer's accounting policies, such measure would meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. For example, if the sales figure in same-store sales is sales presented on a constant-dollar basis, this constant-dollar sales figure meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure since it excludes amounts (i.e., the effect of foreign exchange differences) that are included in the most directly comparable financial measure presented in the primary financial statements (i.e., sales). As a result, the constant dollar same-store sales measure in this example would meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure or the constant dollar same-store sales per square foot measure would meet the definition of a non-GAAP ratio. If an issuer discloses a financial measure that is a component of a financial statement line item to explain how the financial statement line item changed from period to period (in dollars or as a percentage, for instance), such a measure would not meet the definition of a supplementary financial measure if the measure is not intended to be disclosed on a periodic basis. For example, if an issuer experienced an unexpected increase in administrative expenses, it may analyze the reasons for changes in administrative expenses by, among other things, disclosing information about its insurance expense, a component of overall administrative expenses. In this example, insurance expense would not meet the definition of a supplementary financial measure because, among other things, the insurance expense was calculated in accordance with the accounting policies used to prepare the administrative expenses line item presented in the primary financial statements. Periodic Basis An element of the definition of a supplementary financial measure is that it is disclosed or is intended to be disclosed on a periodic basis. A measure will not be precluded from being considered a supplementary financial measure the first time it is disclosed if the measure is intended to be disclosed on an ongoing basis (e.g., in future quarterly and/or annual disclosures). Financial Ratios A financial ratio that is not a non-GAAP ratio would typically meet the definition of supplementary financial measure because such ratio is often disclosed on a periodic basis to depict historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flow. Financial ratios contain at least one financial component (either the numerator or the denominator). Examples include, but are not limited to the following ratios: Liquidity ratios such as the current ratio; Solvency ratios such as the debt-to-equity ratio; Profitability ratios such as the return on equity ratio or revenue per user; and Activity ratios such as the inventory turnover ratio.

Usefulness of a specified financial measure"}
{"metadata":"11626","text":"Clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(C) of the Instrument requires a quantitative reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable financial measure presented in the primary financial statements. For the purpose of clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(C), a quantitative reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure is required to be the permitted format outlined in subsection 6(2) of the Instrument. An issuer may satisfy this requirement by providing a reconciliation in a clearly understandable way, such as a table. For purposes of presenting the reconciliation, an issuer may begin with the non-GAAP financial measure or the most directly comparable financial measure presented in the primary financial statements, provided the reconciliation is presented in an understandable and consistent manner. Most Directly Comparable Financial Measure The Instrument does not define the most directly comparable financial measure and therefore the issuer needs to apply judgment in determining the most directly comparable financial measure. In applying judgment, it is important for an issuer to consider the context of how the non-GAAP financial measure is used. For example, when the non-GAAP financial measure is discussed primarily as a performance measure used in determining cash generated by the issuer, or the issuer's distribution-paying capacity, its most directly comparable financial measure will be from the statement of cash flows. In practice, earnings-based measures and cash flow-based measures are used to disclose operational performance. If it is not clear from the way the non-GAAP financial measure is used what the most directly comparable financial measure is, consideration can be given to the nature, number and materiality of the reconciling items. Reconciling Items The reconciliation must be quantitative, separately itemizing and explaining each significant reconciling item. Source of Reconciling Items When a reconciling item is taken directly from the entity's financial statements, it should be named such that an investor is able to identify the item in those financial statements, and no further explanation of that reconciling item is required. When a reconciling item is not extracted directly from the entity's financial statements, but is, for example, a component of a line item in the entity's primary financial statements or originates from outside the primary financial statements, disclosure must be provided to satisfy clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(C) and subsection 6(2) of the Instrument. Such disclosure should identify the source of the reconciling item (e.g., the financial statement line item, the financial statement note, or the externally sourced document), if not obvious, and should explain how the amount is calculated, including a discussion of any significant judgments or estimates management has made in developing the reconciling items used in the reconciliation. Entity-Specific Inputs Reconciling items should be calculated using entity-specific inputs. An entity may make adjustments that are accepted within an industry; however, the quantum of these adjustments should be calculated using entity-specific information. For example, an entity may make an adjustment for operating capital expenditures, which is a standard adjustment in certain industries, but the amount of the adjustment should be calculated based on the entity's operating capital expenditures, and not by using only an 'industry average' amount as the sole factor. However, adjustments should be supportable and consistent with the usefulness explanation provided to address clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(B) of the Instrument. Level of Detail The level of detail expected in the reconciliation depends on the nature and complexity of the reconciling items. The adjustments made"}
{"metadata":"11626","text":"from the most directly comparable financial measure should be consistent with the explanation required by clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(B) of the Instrument regarding why the information is useful to investors and if applicable, how it is used by management. Explanations should be more detailed than merely stating what the reconciling item represents and should also cover the circumstances that give rise to the particular adjustment if it is not obvious. An other or adjusting items category to describe numerous insignificant reconciling items should not be used without further explanation as to the nature of items that comprise the category. Gross Basis Issuers should consider significant reconciling items on a gross basis. For example, an issuer is expected to separately itemize positive and negative adjustments unless netting is permitted under the financial reporting framework used in the preparation of the financial statements. Tax Reconciling items are commonly presented on a pre-tax basis to ensure that investors understand the gross amount of each reconciling item. If an issuer chooses to present reconciling items on a post-tax basis then the tax effect for each reconciling item should also be disclosed. Comparatives For comparative non-GAAP financial measures disclosed for a previous period under paragraph 6(1)(f) of the Instrument, a reconciliation to the corresponding most directly comparable financial measure is required for that previous period. Presentation in the Form of a Primary Financial Statement An issuer may present adjusted financial information outside the entity's financial statements using a format that is similar to one or more of the primary financial statements, but that is not in accordance with the financial reporting framework used to prepare the entity's financial statements. In this case, the adjusted financial information would contain non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, this would arise if an issuer presents such financial measures in a form that is similar to the following financial statements: A statement of financial position; A statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income; A statement of changes in equity; or A statement of cash flows. Presentation of this information as a single column that excludes the most directly comparable financial measures in a separate column would not satisfy clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(C) and subsection 6(2) of the Instrument. However, this information may be presented in the form of a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure if such presentation shows in separate columns each of the most directly comparable financial measures, the reconciling items, and the non-GAAP financial measures. An example of the separate column approach may be used when issuers with joint ventures present a full set of non-GAAP financial statements in the form of a columnar reconciliation that shows the issuer's statement of income as presented in the primary financial statements, an additional column with amounts related to equity accounted investees for each financial statement line item, and then a total column for each financial statement line item, which would be appropriately labelled as non-GAAP financial measures for each financial statement line item. This effectively creates the presentation of a full set of non-GAAP financial statements. When the adjusted presentation is used as a basis for the qualitative discussions and analysis of an entity's financial performance, financial position or cash flows with greater prominence than financial measures presented in the primary financial statements, this would not be considered to be in compliance with the prominence requirement in paragraph 6(1)(d) of the Instrument. Reconciliation of a non-GAAP financial measure"}
{"metadata":"11627","text":"If the label or composition of the non-GAAP financial measure or non-GAAP ratio has changed from what was previously disclosed, the requirement of clauses 6(1)(e)(ii)(D) and 8(c)(iii)(C) of the Instrument would apply. Including additional reconciling items or excluding previously included reconciling items between the non-GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable financial measure constitutes a change in composition. A clear explanation of the reason for this change is required under clauses 6(1)(e)(ii)(D) and 8(c)(iii)(C) of the Instrument, which would include a restatement of comparatives, when disclosed as required under paragraph 6(1)(f) or 8(d). A change in magnitude of an individual item would not constitute a change in composition. For example, an issuer may define adjusted earnings as earnings before impairment losses and transaction costs. Transaction costs may only be incurred every three years, such that there may be no adjustment in year two to reflect transaction costs, but there should be an explanation noting that the issuer expects that it will incur transaction costs in the future. In this example, the issuer should continue to include transaction costs in the explanation of the composition under clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(A) or 8(c)(iii)(A) to maintain consistency of the non-GAAP financial measure or non-GAAP ratio. Given that disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios is optional, disclosing a particular non-GAAP financial measure or non-GAAP ratio does not create an obligation to continue disclosing that measure in future periods. If, however, an issuer replaces a non-GAAP financial measure or a non-GAAP ratio with another measure or ratio, fraction or similar representation that achieves the same objectives (that is, the usefulness information provided to comply with clauses 6(1)(e)(ii)(B) and 8(c)(iii)(B) of the Instrument was consistent for both measures), the requirement of clauses 6(1)(e)(ii)(D) and 8(c)(iii)(C) of the Instrument would apply. If the label of a non-GAAP financial measure or non-GAAP ratio has changed, while the explanation for the change may be incorporated by reference, we expect the issuer to make it clear in the document that the label has changed in the current period from that disclosed in the prior period. Explanation of the reason for the change in a non-GAAP financial measure or a non-GAAP ratio"}
{"metadata":"11628","text":"Impracticable Understandably, it is impracticable for an issuer to provide the comparative disclosure required by paragraph 6(1)(f) or 8(d) of the Instrument when the current period is the first period of operations and no comparative period exists. However, when a comparative period exists, we do not consider the cost or the time involved in preparing the comparative information to be sufficient rationale for an issuer to assert that it is impracticable to disclose such information. Changes in Accounting Standards We would not consider adoption of a new accounting standard, which would include adoption of amendments to current accounting standards, or a change in accounting policy, to be a basis for not presenting comparative period disclosure, as the composition of the non-GAAP financial measure should continue to be the same. Adoption of new accounting standards, or changes in accounting policy, may modify measurement and recognition of transactions which will have an impact on line items, subtotals and totals over different financial periods. However, the composition of the non-GAAP financial measure itself should not change. Consider, for example, an issuer that discloses EBITDA as its non-GAAP financial measure, and in the current year adopts a new accounting standard which modifies the classification of certain expenditures from administrative expense to interest expense. While the resulting EBITDA measure will no longer include those transactions, EBITDA will continue to have the same composition, as it will comprise earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Therefore, the issuer would not be subject to the explanation of the reason for the change disclosure under clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(D). The financial reporting framework used to prepare an entity's financial statements would determine whether comparative information is restated with adoption of a new accounting standard or change in accounting policy. For example, we expect comparative non-GAAP financial measures to be restated when a new accounting standard or policy is applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented. Conversely, if a new accounting standard is applied prospectively or retrospectively without restatement of a prior reporting period presented, the specified financial measures would also not be restated. In such circumstances, the issuer communicates that the comparative non-GAAP financial measures are disclosed under the previous financial reporting framework used to prepare the entity's financial statements. In both cases, the composition of the specified financial measure has not changed, and the explanation of the reason for the change disclosure under clause 6(1)(e)(ii)(D) would not be required.

The issuer must also comply with section 6 of the Instrument in respect of the equivalent historical non-GAAP financial measure disclosed. The equivalent historical non-GAAP financial measure must have the same composition as a non-GAAP financial measure that is forward-looking information. For example, adjusted EBITDA would be the equivalent historical non-GAAP financial measure of forward-looking adjusted EBITDA. Determining the relevant historical period to satisfy the requirement in paragraph 7(2)(a) of the Instrument is a matter of judgment, considering the time period covered by the forward-looking information and the extent to which the business of the issuer is cyclical or seasonal. For example, when an issuer discloses forward-looking information for the three months ending June 30, 20X2, the relevant period for the equivalent historical non-GAAP financial measure may be: Where the business of the issuer is not seasonal, the issuer's most recent interim period for which annual financial statements or an interim financial report has been filed (e.g., the three months ended March 31, 20X2); or Where the business of the issuer is seasonal, the comparable historical interim period to that of the financial outlook disclosed (e.g., the three months ended June 30, 20X1).

However, the principle that the non-GAAP ratios and capital management measures should be presented with no more prominence than that of measures from the primary financial statements remains the same. Many non-GAAP ratios and capital management measures do not have a most directly comparable financial measure. As such, issuers should consider the disclosure of the non-GAAP ratio and capital management measure in relation to the overall disclosure of similar financial measures presented in the primary financial statements to which the non-GAAP ratio or the capital management measure relates. For example, the prominence requirement in paragraph 8(b) of the Instrument is not met if the issuer focused its disclosure on an increased gross margin percentage without giving at least equally prominent disclosure to the fact that sales have significantly decreased over the same time period, resulting in a reduction in total profit period over period. In this example, it is assumed that the financial measure of gross margin is not presented in the primary financial statements and therefore meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. As a further example, the discussion of a total cash cost per ounce financial measure should not be more prominent than the discussion of cost of sales, the similar financial measure presented in the primary financial statements to which the non-GAAP ratio relates. An issuer that discloses a capital management measure such as adjusted debt will meet the requirement in paragraph 10(1)(a) by giving at least equally prominent disclosure to similar financial measures presented in the primary financial statements such as short-term and long-term debt. For a non-GAAP ratio or a capital management measure which has a most directly comparable financial measure presented in the primary financial statements, the guidance on prominence contained in this Policy for paragraph 6(1)(d) should be referred to. For example, the most directly comparable financial measure of adjusted earnings per share is earnings per share and we expect that the discussion of adjusted earnings per share should not be more prominent than the discussion of earnings per share.

When disclosed outside the financial statements, the disclosures made under section 9 of the Instrument should allow a reader to understand how these total of segments measures are calculated and how they relate to measures presented in the entity's primary financial statements. An example of a total of segments measure is when an issuer discloses adjusted EBITDA for each of its reportable segments in the notes to the financial statements: segment A, segment B, and segment C. The issuer then sums the adjusted EBITDA for each segment and discloses total entity-adjusted EBITDA. Entity-adjusted EBITDA is a total of segments measure and is not presented in the primary financial statements. When this financial measure is disclosed in a document other than the financial statements, the issuer must comply with section 9 of the Instrument. For clarity, the individual segment adjusted EBITDA measure for segment A, for instance, would not be captured as a total of segments measure and would not be subject to section 9 of the Instrument. If an issuer discloses a financial measure of a reportable segment and such financial measure is not presented or disclosed in the financial statements to which the financial measure relates, the issuer should consider whether this financial measure meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. A total of segments measure does not include a component of a financial statement line item for which the component has been calculated in accordance with the accounting policies used to prepare the line item presented in the financial statements (see Component Information in section 1 of the Policy). An SEC issuer may characterize a total of segments measure as a non-GAAP financial measure in compliance with SEC rules on non-GAAP financial measures and in doing so, the issuer would be complying with the requirements in section 9 of the Instrument in respect of this measure.

Staff cautions issuers that regulatory action may be taken if an issuer discloses information in a manner considered misleading and therefore potentially harmful to the public interest. Purpose"}
{"metadata":"11677","text":"For the purpose of this notice, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of an issuer's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flow that is not specified, defined or determined under the issuer's GAAP (as that term is defined in National Instrument 52-107 Acceptable Accounting Principles and Auditing Standards) and is not presented in an issuer's financial statements. A non-GAAP financial measure excludes amounts that are included in, or includes amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure specified, defined or determined under the issuer's GAAP. Some issuers disclose non-GAAP financial measures in press releases, management's discussion and analysis, prospectus filings, websites and marketing materials. Many non-GAAP financial measures are derived from profit or loss determined under an issuer's GAAP and, by omission of selected items, present a more positive picture of financial performance. Terms used to identify non-GAAP financial measures may include pro forma earnings, cash earnings, free cash flow, distributable cash, Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings, and earnings before non-recurring items. Many of these terms lack standard meanings and different issuers may use the same term to refer to different calculations. Staff is concerned that investors may be confused or even misled by non-GAAP financial measures. Staff is also concerned about the prominence of disclosure given to non-GAAP financial measures related to earnings compared to the prominence of earnings measures specified, defined or determined under an issuer's GAAP. In staff's view, these concerns can be addressed by appropriate disclosure accompanying non-GAAP financial measures. Some issuers disclose performance measures that are calculated without using financial measures (for example, number of units or number of subscribers). Some issuers disclose performance measures that are calculated using financial information presented in the financial statements (for example, sales per square foot, where the sales figure is extracted directly from the financial statements). In both of the preceding scenarios, such performance measures are not considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. However, if a non-GAAP financial measure is used to calculate a performance measure (such as an adjusted earnings financial measure used to calculate an adjusted earnings per unit measure), then that non-GAAP financial measure should be disclosed and Section III of this notice applies to that non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP Financial Measures"}
{"metadata":"11678","text":"Financial statements prepared in accordance with an issuer's GAAP provide investors with a clear basis for financial analysis and comparison among issuers. Staff recognizes that non-GAAP financial measures may provide investors with additional information to assist them in understanding critical components of an issuer's financial performance. However, an issuer should not present a non-GAAP financial measure in a way that confuses or obscures the most directly comparable measure specified, defined or determined under the issuer's GAAP presented in its financial statements. Staff reminds issuers of their responsibility to ensure that information they provide to the public is not misleading. Staff also reminds certifying officers of their obligations under National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings to make certifications regarding misrepresentations, fair presentation, and disclosure controls and procedures. A non-GAAP financial measure may be misleading if it includes positive components of the most directly comparable measure specified, defined or determined under the issuer's GAAP presented in its financial statements but omits similar negative components. In order to ensure that a non-GAAP financial measure does not mislead investors, an issuer should: state explicitly that the non-GAAP financial measure does not have any standardized meaning under the issuer's GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers; name the non-GAAP financial measure in a way that distinguishes it from disclosure items specified, defined or determined under an issuer's GAAP and in a way that is not misleading. For example, in presenting EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial measure, it would be misleading to exclude amounts for items other than interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; explain why the non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors and the additional purposes, if any, for which management uses the non-GAAP financial measure; present with equal or greater prominence to that of the non-GAAP financial measure, the most directly comparable measure specified, defined or determined under the issuer's GAAP presented in its financial statements; provide a clear quantitative reconciliation from the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable measure specified, defined or determined under the issuer's GAAP and presented in its financial statements, referencing to the reconciliation when the non-GAAP financial measure first appears in the document, or in the case of content on a website, in a manner that meets this objective (for example, by providing a link to the reconciliation); ensure that the non-GAAP financial measure does not describe adjustments as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, when a similar loss or gain is reasonably likely to occur within the next two years or occurred during the prior two years; and present the non-GAAP financial measure on a consistent basis from period to period; however, where an issuer changes the composition of the non-GAAP financial measure, explain the reason for the change and restate any comparative period presented.
